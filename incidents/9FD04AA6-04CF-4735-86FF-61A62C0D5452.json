  "summary": "A concerned citizen found hundreds of documents in a recycling center and notified a local news team.  The documents included criminal histories, depositions, medical records, personal phone numbers, and addresses.  Most were from the 1990's.  Most or all of the information did not need to be shredded because it was considered public record.  The local news team contacted a director from the solid waste division and the documents were removed for shredding.",
