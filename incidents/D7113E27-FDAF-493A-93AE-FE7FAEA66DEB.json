  "summary": "Data were exposed to the Internet, including financial account numbers and approximately 350,000 social security numbers. The exposure has been  remedied, and the University is acting to alert people who may have been affected by this exposure. However, because of the size and nature of the incident, the University is unable to determine at this time whether any individual New Hampshire residents were affected. Out of an abundance of caution, the University is providing you with notice of the data exposure incident in case New Hampshire residents are involved.  Due to incorrect access settings, large amounts of electronic data hosted by the University were accessible from the Internet. There were two exposure issues, one affecting general University servers over a period of approximately three months, and another affecting the University\u2019s College of Engineering servers over a decade or more.",
