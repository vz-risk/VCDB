  "summary": "A SCOTTISH council has been fined \u00a3140,000 after repeatedly releasing sensitive information about vulnerable children and carers to the wrong people.  Midlothian Council was guilty of five data protection breaches in as many months last year.  It is the first local authority in Scotland to be fined by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), which is calling for stronger auditing powers to detect other breaches.  Midlothian has apologised and said staff have been subject to disciplinary proceedings, but insisted no-one was put at risk.  In one instance, on 1 June, child protection minutes were sent to the former home of a mother\u2019s partner, who had lived there in a previous relationship.  \u201cThe commissioner understands that the former partner may have further disseminated this information to individuals in the wider local community,\u201d the ICO report said.",
