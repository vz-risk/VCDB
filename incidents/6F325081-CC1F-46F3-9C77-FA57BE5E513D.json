  "summary": "Anyone who made a purchase at the Haagen-Daz inside the food court in International Plaza since April of 2012 may have been affected by identity theft. A flash drive that contained key-logger software was connected to a register at the store. It recorded payment card transactions and allowed thieves to make counterfeit credit cards. Two men were arrested in June of 2012 for using fraudulent card information and that information was later linked to the Hagen-Daz shop.",
