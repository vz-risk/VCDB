  "summary": "Grant Lind allegedly was a dumpster diver with a lot of patience and a talent for putting together puzzle pieces.  Lind, 49, was charged last month with 44 felony counts in connection with a check counterfeiting scheme, according to authorities who say he gleaned bank account information from shredded checks he plucked from a Valencia dumpster.  The Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department launched an investigation after a Castaic church reported bank account information had been stolen and used to write counterfeit checks. Detectives discovered 20 different victims, all Santa Clarita Valley residents and businesses, who had one thing in common. They had written checks to Valencia Self Storage in Valencia.  When investigators searched Lind\u2019s residence in Newhall last October, they found check printers, computers and \u201cbags and boxes full of these shredded documents,\u201d said sheriff\u2019s Det. David Lingscheit.  Lind would allegedly take a bag of shreds, divide the contents into smaller boxes and then assemble the pieces, each about 2 inches long and a quarter-inch wide, on top of the box and piece together bank account and routing numbers.  He then used the information to print and write more than 30 counterfeit checks worth about $16,000, authorities said.",
