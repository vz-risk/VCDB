  "summary": "Drake International, the Canadian-based job placement firm, confirmed Wednesday that it has been the victim of a hacking scheme by a group seeking to extort payment in exchange for not releasing the personal information of people who have used Drake\u2019s services.  With offices in nine countries, Drake has become the latest victim in an increasingly common racket where companies face extortion threats from shadowy groups of hackers after a security breach. It\u2019s a problem that may be too big for many businesses to solve themselves, but one they must address, or they face the risk of damage to their reputations and a potential loss of business.",
