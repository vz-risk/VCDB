  "summary": "A federal judge on Monday sentenced a Baltimore County man to 11 years in prison and ordered him to pay close to $200,000 in restitution to victims of a wire fraud and identity theft scheme that victimized Johns Hopkins doctors, among some 250 others, the U.S. Justice Department said.  Derrick Hill, 53, of Woodlawn, previously pleaded guilty to the charges, along with co-conspirators Renee Cabell, 51, John Coffey, 43, and Tawney King, 46.  Authorities said Hill and the other defendants stole identities, then cashed counterfeit checks and rented apartments in the names of victims. Cabell provided Hill with the names and identity information of doctors who applied for fellowships at Johns Hopkins Hospital, where Cabell worked. King, who was employed by Highlandtown Community Health Center, provided Hill with the identifying information of patients.  The rest of the defendants have been sentenced to a few years of prison for each, the U.S. Justice Department said.",
