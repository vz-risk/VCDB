  "summary": "Approximately two months ago, Jackson Health System investigated an alleged violation of a patient\u2019s rights and privacy at Jackson South Community Hospital. In order to avoid compounding the potential breach, we are not disclosing details at this time. While no patients were harmed as a result of this incident, we concluded that Jackson policies were, indeed, violated. Consistent with our culture of accountability, employees were terminated or otherwise disciplined. Appropriate reports were made to regulatory agencies. Rest assured that we hold patient privacy and quality of care as core values at all Jackson facilities.  Two managers, South\u2019s chief nursing officer and the head of the obstetrics unit, resigned as a result of the breach.  Update: According to sources, the child was born on Oct. 4 and abandoned by its mother. A couple of days later the newborn was taken from the second-floor nursery to the first floor.  The hospital security band was taken off the baby, and a family looking to adopt was directly contacted by one of the employees and went to the hospital to see the baby, the sources told NBC 6 South Florida.",
