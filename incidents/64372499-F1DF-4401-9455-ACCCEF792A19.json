According to an announcement on the hospital's Web site, the laptop \"could potentially contain limited medical inforamtion on pediatric patients,\" though there's no evidence at this point the the data has been compromised.  The medical information on the laptop pertained to operating room schedules, and could have included approximately 12,900 patients' names, ages, medical record numbers, phone numbers, surgical proecures, and physicians, from a three-year period beginning in 2009.",
