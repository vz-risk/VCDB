The IRS acknowledged the mistake and Public.Resource.org became curious about where else the information could be found.  Public.Resource.org found multiple incidents of Social Security numbers being exposed on the IRS website and wrote a letter that pointed out the issues to the IRS.  The IRS was able to remove some or all of the sensitive files from public view over the course of a few days.",
