UMHS vendor Omnicell alerted the health system Nov. 20 that electronic equipment storing patient information was stolen from the car of an Omnicell employee Nov. 14, according to a UMHS news release. The equipment contained medication, demographic and health information from patients at three hospitals who were seen between Oct. 24 and Nov. 13. The information did not include addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, credit card, debit card or bank account numbers.  Omnicell told UMHS the data was on an unsecured electronic device, a violation of UMHS\u2019 and Omnicell\u2019s standard policies and procedures.",
