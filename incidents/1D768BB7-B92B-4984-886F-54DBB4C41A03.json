  "summary": "A hacker has posted around 300,000 database entries of Verizon customers to the Web, after exploiting a vulnerability in the cellular giant's network.  The hacker, going by the name @TibitXimer on Twitter, told ZDNet earlier this evening that the hack was carried out earlier this year on July 12, which allowed him to gain root access to the server holding the customer data. Tibit gained access to a server with little difficulty after working with another hacker to identify the security flaw.  Updated on December 22 at 8:00 p.m. ET: Verizon spokesperson Alberto Canal told ZDNet in an emailed statement: \"We have examined the posted data and we have confirmed that it is not Verizon Wireless customer data. Our systems have not been hacked.\"  The hacker said in a later tweet the data likely belongs to Verizon FiOS fiber customers, rather than Verizon Wireless cellular customers. We've updated the post to reflect these changes. We've put in more questions to Verizon and will update again once we hear back.",
