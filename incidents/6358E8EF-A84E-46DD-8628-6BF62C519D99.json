  "summary": "Word on the streets is that Major League Baseball and Alex Rodriguez will soon come to an agreement concerning a suspension for using performance enhancing drugs (PEDs). Rodriguez has never failed a drug test, at least not officially, yet commissioner Bud Selig and his minions want to suspend him for life. Rodriguez has a problem with that, especially the part where the New York Yankees get out of paying him the remaining $100 million left on his contract.  The evidence against A-Rod is based on stolen medical records obtained from Porter Fischer, an ex-employee of Biogenesis of America, an anti-aging clinic in Coral Gables, Florida. The clinic has since closed. Reportedly, MLB paid Fischer for the records. Fischer stole the medical records from Biogenesis of America because he believed the clinic owed him some money, $4,000 to be exact. ",
