  "summary": "A local healthcare company is now trying to contact 10,000 job applicants whose private information was exposed in a major security breach.  The applicants at Piedmont HealthCare had more than just their applications stolen; they had their Social Security numbers compromised.  A later story indicates that 2000 patients card details were also compromised.  The applications were stored on the same server that Presbyterian Anesthesia Associations used to store their bill payment information.  Ten thousand patients there had their credit card information stolen.",
