  "summary": "Bloomberg News reporters were able to monitor clients' usage of data terminals leased from Bloomberg LP.  Goldman Sachs is one of the companies that has complained publicly while JP Morgan Chase, the Federal Reserve, and the United States Treasury Department have started investigations. It is unclear how many other organizations may have been affected.  Reporters may have routinely retrieved login and contact information from data-services clients over the past 20 years.  Some reporters had access to information on when and how often clients logged into their terminals, their most frequently used functions and contact information.",
