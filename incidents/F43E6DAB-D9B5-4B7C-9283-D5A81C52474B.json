  "summary": "A Gardiner woman has pleaded guilty to stealing the identities of people she was supposed to help get property tax relief.  Federal prosecutors say 43-year-old Joann Rittall pleaded guilty Thursday to identity theft and fraud charges which led to $240,000 in tax refunds to which she was not entitled.  She was released pending sentencing.  Prosecutors say Rittall helped more than 20 people file claims under Maine\u2019s Residents Property Tax and Rent Refund \u2018\u2018Circuit Breaker\u2019\u2019 Program. She then used their personal information to file federal income tax returns claiming refunds in their names.  The Kennebec Journal (http://bit.ly/16TD6y9 ) reports that Rittall directed the refunds to be sent to bank accounts she had opened.  She also agreed to repay almost $220,000 to the U.S. Treasury and almost $20,000 to the state of Maine.",
