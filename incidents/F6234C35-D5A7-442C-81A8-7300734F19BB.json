M2ComSys, according to the Tennessean, left physician notes available to the public from May 5 to June 24 because it didn\u2019t activate a firewall.  The physician notes included information such as physician\u2019s name, patients\u2019 date of birth, diagnosis descriptions, summaries of treatments provided, medical histories and medical record numbers. Cogent said that patients\u2019 medical records and Social Security numbers were not revealed.* As a result of the breach, Cogent said that it\u2019s ending its relationship with M2ComSys and has collaborated with Google to ensure there are no remnants of exposed data.
