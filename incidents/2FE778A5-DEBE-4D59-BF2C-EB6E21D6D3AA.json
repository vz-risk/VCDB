  "summary": "Nayeliz Soto told police she knew it was wrong to use credit card numbers stolen from customers to make more than $6,000 in purchases at the Greenacres Walmart where she worked.  But she wanted to help co-worker Nadia Saint Jean feed her children, according to Greenacres police.  Both women were arrested Monday at the Walmart, at 6294 Forest Hill Blvd., after a camera captured Soto writing down a customer's credit card information on May 22 and giving it to Saint Jean, who used it to buy two Visa gift cards, according to a Greenacres police arrest report.",
