  "summary": "LexisNexis informed Sprechman & Associates that the unusual, excessive activity of an associate caused them to eliminate that associate's access to LexisNexis' database.  The associate was later found to have misused Social Security numbers in order to file over 11 million dollars in fraudulent tax refund claims. The dishonest associate was not immediately fired from Sprechman & Associates and was terminated in July 2012 when law enforcement used a warrant to search his home and office computers.  ",
