  "summary": "Ward's Nursery & Garden Center may be one of the businesses at the center of a security breach resulting in fraudulent purchases this month made with dozens of locals' credit and debit cards.  Gregory Ward, co-owner of the South Main Street store, said his company was contacted by a bank regarding the possible security breach, after which Ward's immediately reached out to law enforcement officials.  The exact number of cardholders who've been affected is unknown at this time. But it's believed dozens of customers from various local and national banks had their credit or debit card information stolen and used to make fraudulent purchases around the world. It's possible that hundreds of customers' information was stolen over a two-month period concluding last week. ",
