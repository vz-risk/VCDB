  "summary": "A federal judge ordered home arrest for an American linguist accused of stealing national security secrets while working at a U.S. Navy base in Bahrain.      James Hitselberger, 56, is fluent in Arabic, Farsi and Russian. Global Linguist Solutions assigned him to the naval base in Bahrain in 2011, but the government said he illegally retained national defense information on two occasions during this placement.      After naval investigators interviewed him about he allegations, they told him the company wanted him to return to the United States to be officially fired.      Instead Hitselberger traveled through Europe for several months, communicating with friends through his government-monitored email account and updating his Facebook page with pictures of sightseeing.",
