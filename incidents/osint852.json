  "summary": "The personal information of almost 1,000 Haringey Council residents has been found dumped in an abandoned council building.  The data lost included names, dates of birth, addresses, bank details and some housing tenancy data of housing benefit claimants. The files were overlooked and left in a cupboard when the former Haringey Council housing benefits office was vacated in 2005.  A spokesman for Haringey Council said, \u201cThe council is going through all the files and will be writing to the people whose records have been found, to allay fears regarding their personal information and giving advice about what action the individuals should take if they have concerns regarding any misuse of their personal information.\"",
