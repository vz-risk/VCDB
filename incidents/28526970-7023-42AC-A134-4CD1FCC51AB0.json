  "summary": "A former employee received a CD with the names and Social Security numbers of around 200 current and former employees when he requested his personnel file.  The disc may have held the information of employees who signed up for a specific dental insurance plan in 1996 and workers who joined the Utah Public Employees Association in 1999.  When the HR department realized their mistake they requested that the former employee return the CD.  He initially refused; he then gave the CD to the Tooele County Attorney's office.  ",
