  "summary": "A former loan officer at the $604 million Consumer\u2019sCreditUnion in Waukegan, Ill. was sentenced in federal court last week to 35 months in prison and ordered to pay restitution for a scheme that involved $1.4 million in fraudulent loans, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Milwaukee, Wisc.  James Scalzo, 46, who also worked as a loan officer at Fox River State Bank in Burlington, Wisc., pled guilty to money-laundering and bank fraud charges earlier this year after admitting in a plea agreement that he originated and approved fraudulent loans at both FIs in 2008-2009, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.  Scalva was ordered to serve three years supervised release following his prison term and to pay $200 in special assessments, the press release said, with the terms of restitution to be determined at a later date.  The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office said Scalvo\u2019s actions caused personal and financial hardship to numerous victims, including a couple whose home was pledged as collateral for a fraudulent loan and then allowed to go into foreclosure.",
