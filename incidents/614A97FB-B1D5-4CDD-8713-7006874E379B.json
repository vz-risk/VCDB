  "summary": "The federal agency charged with preventing the flow of money to organized crime and terrorists had an encrypted laptop, hard copy reports and an unencrypted USB memory stick stolen in October, exposing the personal information of patrons to two Alberta casinos, including how much money they gambled.  The encrypted laptop and reports were inside a locked briefcase that was stolen out of the locked trunk of a rental car in broad daylight while a FINTRAC employee had left the vehicle in a Calgary parking lot while apparently going for lunch.",
