  "summary": "California's San Jose Medical Supply Company recently began notifying current and former customers of a breach of their personal information, which took place in 2011 but was only recently discovered by the company's new management.  When the company's former owned died in August 2011, the company continued operating under the management of trustees.  In August 2012, current president Jesille Kuizon purchased the company, and discovered what Kuizon describes in the notification letter [PDF] as \"suspicious activity taken by the former employees, officers and/or agents of the prior owner, which may have compromised the security of your health information.\"",
