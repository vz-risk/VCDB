  "summary": "Michael Musacchio, a 61-year-old man from Plano, Texas, was convicted by a federal jury for conspiring to hack into the computer networks of his former employer.  According to the US Department of Justice, between 2002 and 2004, Musacchio was the president of a third-party logistics company called Exel Transportation Services.  In 2004, the man left the firm and founded a competing company, Total Transportation Services.  Between 2004 and 2006, Musacchio and two other Exel employees that joined him at Total hacked into the email accounts of their former employer in an effort to obtain proprietary business information which they used for their own benefit.  Musacchio, found guilty of one felony count of conspiracy to make unauthorized access to a protected computer and two substantive felony counts of hacking, will be sentenced on June 14.  His accomplices, Joseph Roy Brown and John Michael Kelly, who have already pleaded guilty to the charges brought against them, will also be sentenced in the upcoming period.",
