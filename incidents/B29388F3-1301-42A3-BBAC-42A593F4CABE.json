  "summary": "A total of ten individuals were charged last week for their alleged involvement in a massive identity theft ring that operated in the Washington DC metropolitan area.  According to the indictment, Blalock and Bush recruited women to steal personal information from the companies they worked for.  The scheme, which was running since at least January 2012, has made at least 600 victims, including overseas-based employees of the US Department of State, the US Department of Defense, and the US Agency for International Development.  The information stolen from companies such as a car rental firm, an insurer and a local dental practice was used to manufacture fraudulent identification documents that were later utilized to open credit lines on behalf of the victims.
