The Rensselaer County Jail information is maintained by Samaritan Hospital.  The hospital learned of the breach in November 2011, disabled the employee's account, and notified the sheriff's office immediately.  Subsequently, the Hospital may have delayed notifying patients because of the ongoing investigation.  Notifications were sent out during the first week of March in 2013.UPDATE (04/01/2013): A total of 48 people have been notified.  Patients from as far back as 2006 may have been affected.",
