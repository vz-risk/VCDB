  "summary": "Adetiloye, 40, pleaded guilty on February 16, 2011, to participating in a scheme to defraud financial institutions and individuals out of money. Adetiloye was living in Toronto, Canada, from before January of 2005 to May of 2010, when he was extradited to the United States. During that time, Adetiloye funded a lavish lifestyle by conducting, with others, a massive fraud scheme accomplished by executing tens of thousands of fraudulent acts against individual people, financial institutions, commercial data providers, merchants, commercial mailbox companies, and state agencies.  Adetiloye\u2019s scheme involved tens of thousands of acts of illegal conduct throughout the United States, as well as in Canada and England. Adetiloye and his co-conspirators fraudulently obtained the personal identification information from commercial data providers, such as LexisNexis and ChoicePoint, and with that information assumed the identities of those unsuspecting people to open credit card and other bank accounts at U.S. Bank and twenty other banks across the United States.
