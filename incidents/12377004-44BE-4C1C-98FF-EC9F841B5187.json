  "summary": "A hacker attack which infiltrated Germany\u2019s federal police computer system using Trojan programs and a system of routes via Russia last summer was due to a row about internet usage between a top cop and his daughter. It resulted in the \u201cPatras\u201d server being closed down \u2013 meaning that federal police had to halt operations tracking suspects and their vehicles. Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich subsequently said computer security would be made a top priority.  Der Spiegel magazine reported on Sunday that the Frankfurt officer concerned had put a Trojan program on his daughter\u2019s computer to monitor her activities in the internet.  A friend of the young woman from the hacker scene discovered her father\u2019s spyware \u2013 and hacked into his computer in order to get back at him. There he found work emails which enabled him to get into the federal police computer system, the magazine said. ",
