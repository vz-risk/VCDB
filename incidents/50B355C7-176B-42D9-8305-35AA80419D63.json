The database became apparent when the department confirmed to TAI that it had initiated an internal investigation into whether the private health information of thousands of people with HIV and their partners had been improperly released. The state\u2019s investigation found that a contractor had emailed some data within the HIV Event System from a protected government server \u2013 without encryption \u2013 to an email address at the company that created and maintains the database for the state. The state determined that no private information was released.  According to Rick\u2019s report, the violation occurred late last year when an employee of A.J. Boggs & Company \u2014 a subcontractor that provides technology services to MDCH \u2014 sent an unencrypted email attachment to the company\u2019s CEO that included thousands of pages of health and demographic information from the state\u2019s HIV database.",
