  "summary": "The New York Times' computer system was hacked after Chinese government officials warned the Times about consequences for investigating the wealth of government family members.  The Times began monitoring its system closely on October 24 and noticed unusual activity on October 25 when an article about the wealth of a Chinese official's family was published.  The breach began on September 13 and was allowed to continue until January so that the hackers' behavior could be studied.  It appears that the passwords of every Times employee were compromised and 53 Times employees had their personal computers accessed.  The 53 employees were located outside of the United States and appear to have been the ones who may have covered the Chinese stories.",
