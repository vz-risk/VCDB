  "summary": "A hack affected less than 1% of Scribd's 50 million users. \"A few hundred thousand\" users had their passwords stolen.  Users who were affected received instructions for resetting passwords.  The passwords were encrypted and it is unlikely that hackers were able to decrypt and use the passwords before Scribd and Scribd users learned of the breach.",
