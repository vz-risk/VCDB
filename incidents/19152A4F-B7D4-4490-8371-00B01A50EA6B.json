  "summary": "On March 22, 2013, law enforcement notified El Centro that x-rays we had provided to a trusted vendor for digitization and destruction were missing from a storage warehouse and may not have been properly destroyed.  We immediately began a thorough internal investigation to determine what happened to the x-rays, but we have been unable to find the missing x-rays and have not been able to make contact with the vendor.  The missing documents include patients\u2019 x-rays, paper jackets containing the films, and sometimes a written interpretation. The information involved may include patient names, dates of birth, addresses, medical record numbers, El Centro account numbers, physicians\u2019 names, diagnoses, radiology procedures, radiology interpretations, health insurance numbers, and in some instances Social Security numbers. We no longer do business with the vendor. ",
