  "summary": "What do a hospital volunteer, a cell phone and a McDonald's parking lot have in common? They were all factors in a massive scheme to steal patient identities. The fallout led Miami's Jackson Health System to ban smartphones for all volunteers across the system, Report on Patient Privacy on AIS Health reported.  In March 2012, three men were found filing fake tax returns, using free WiFi in a McDonald's parking lot. One of the men, Loverson Gelmine, was a volunteer Jackson Memorial North's emergency department. Using his cell phone camera, Gelmine took approximately 1,100 photos of patient records that contained Social Security numbers and other health information, which he then sold to one of the other men. The scam landed him almost four years of prison time.  The ID theft ring reminds hospitals about the dangers of paper records, cell phones and volunteers.  Following the data breach, disclosed in November, Jackson Health tightened security and issued a system-wide policy that prohibited volunteers from using cell phones in patient areas.",
