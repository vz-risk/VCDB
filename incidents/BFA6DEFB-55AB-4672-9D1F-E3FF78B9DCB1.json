  "summary": "The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences is letting some 1,500 patients know their information was kept without permission by a resident physician after she was terminated.  The health care facility plans to mail impacted patients who had surgery or were seen by a neurosurgeon from January to June 2010. Some patient data included name, address, date of birth, medical record number and date of service. Others also included more sensitive information such as diagnoses, medications, surgical and other procedure names, and lab results.  The breach came to light after the resident physician shared the records with her attorney during a wrongful termination lawsuit hearing.",
