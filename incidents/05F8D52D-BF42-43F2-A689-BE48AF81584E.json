  "summary": "The laptop computer of head of Israel\u2019s Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Shaul Horev has been stolen from his house, Israeli sources say.   Police say the laptop may have contained top-secret information. According to Ynet, Horev is in charge of Israel's nuclear policy.  Horev\u2019s wallet, electronic devices and a number of work-related documents were also stolen after two thieves broke into his house in Moshav Beit Yitzhak, near Netanya, on Sunday.  A statement by the Atomic Energy Commission, however, has said that no sensitive material was stolen from Horev\u2019s house. It also denied a computer was among the items stolen.  The AEC also said that it appears that the robbery was related to the nature of the Horev's work and that the robbers were common criminals. ",
