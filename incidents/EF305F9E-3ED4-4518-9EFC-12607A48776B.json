  "summary": "Estate agent Foxtons is currently investigating a possible data breach, which may have resulted in the personal information of 10,000 customers being compromised.  A list including the email addresses, usernames and passwords, many partially obscured, of alleged MyFoxtons users was posted on Pastebin and linked to on several security sites, but has now been removed.  The list is still available elsewhere, reports PCPro.co.uk and Softpedia.  \"We have been able to download the list of usernames and passwords that were posted and are currently running checks to determine its veracity,\" Foxtons said in an email to MyFoxtons users.  Although the list doesn't contain financial information like credit card details, access to a user's MyFoxtons account could allow a person access to their home address and phone number.  Additionally, a hacker could gain access to MyFoxtons' features that allow landlords to electronically sign documents, manage the payments of rents online and see the deposit registration numbers of their tenants, according to this online demo.  It is not currently known who is behind the reported breach, or how they may have gained access to the data. The list is reportedly labelled \"Part 1\", potentially suggesting that more data is to come.  Foxtons declined to comment.",
