  "summary": "While the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has yet to confirm that it has been breached, Anonymous hackers continue to leak data they\u2019ve allegedly stolen from the organization\u2019s systems.  The second round of data, leaked a few hours ago, consists of contact information for around 200 organizations, including law enforcement agencies and government contractors.  The information is not sensitive, but the hackers have told Vice that it\u2019s just a small part of what they\u2019re sitting on. More leaks will come, but only after the data is analyzed.  The hacktivists say they\u2019ve had access to FEMA\u2019s systems for quite some time, but they\u2019ve stolen only small amounts of data at a time in order not to trigger intrusion detection systems.  As far as the timing is concerned, Anonymous says \u201can opportunity to settle an old score, an insult unanswered, arose.\u201d  They\u2019re targeting FEMA not just because of the cyber exercise in which it simulated an attack from Anonymous, but also because the organization is \u201can active investor in corrupt intelligence/defense/security contractors.\u201d",
