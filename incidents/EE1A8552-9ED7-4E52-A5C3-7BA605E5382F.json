  "summary": "A Dutch MP has been fined \u20ac750 (\u00a3650, $1,000) after he was convicted of illegally accessing the systems of a Dutch medical laboratory.  Henk Krol claims he only accessed the systems of Diagnostics for You in order to expose sloppy security practices. The MP, who is the leader of Dutch minority pensioners party, 50plus, used a login and password that he had obtained from a patient at the clinic in April last year to access and download medical files relating to several people. The patient had apparently overheard the login information from a member of staff.",
