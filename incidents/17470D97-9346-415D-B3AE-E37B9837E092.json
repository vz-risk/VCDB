Employees had inadvertently exposed Social Security numbers, copies of birth certificates, personal medical records, tax returns, bank account information, inmate records, payroll information, court records, and passports.  Employees should have been using locked disposal totes for shredding and were discarding documents in recycling totes instead.",
