  "summary": "A flaw in Coinbase's systems cause the information of some merchants to be exposed.  Any merchant who created a \"buy now\" button, donate button, or hosted a payment page using Coinbase's Merchant Tools and posted a public link to it online had the page publicly visible on the internet.  The page contained the company name, website, phone number, email address, and mailing address.  Additionally, anyone could search for public Coinbase merchant payment pages and collect the email addresses of merchants. At least one phishing attack targeted merchants with an email that appeared to come from Coinbase.",
