  "summary": "The Los Angeles Times learned that a segment of its website housed malicious code for six weeks.  The subdomain OffersandDeals.latimes.com redirected visitors to a malicious website.  The website then used code to receive compensation for web traffic.  The compromise appears to have occurred sometime before December 23, 2012.  An LA Times spokesperson initially responded to the breach by claiming that a glitch in Google's display ad exchange had caused a malicious script warning rather than actual malicious script.",
