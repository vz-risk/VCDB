Thoms asked for her records after undergoing surgery at Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point in Hudson, and was told they would be mailed to her.  Days later, the papers arrived in the mail.  As she opened the envelope and began to look through them, she noticed something was not quite right. \u201cI read the first name and it wasn\u2019t mine, and I turned the page and read the second name and it was not mine,\u201d she said.  By the last page, Thoms counted 10 different patient records, complete with social security numbers. None of them were hers.",
