  "summary": "Bronx cops disposed of dozens of sensitive files by tossing them in the garbage outside the 40th Precinct station house, where they were fair game for local Dumpster divers.  The files \u2014 including at least one domestic-violence report, stolen property records, criminal complaints and mug shots \u2014 were found yesterday by a reporter from News 12 The Bronx.  Red-faced police refused to say how long they\u2019d been there or if anything was missing when they retrieved them.  They also declined to comment on whether any of the paperwork involved live cases.",
