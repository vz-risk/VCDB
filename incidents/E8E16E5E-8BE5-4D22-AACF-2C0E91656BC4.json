  "summary": "Patient data was compromised when Parson gained unauthorized access to his manager\u2019s log-in to the hospital computer system to pull patients Social Security numbers. Additionally, investigators said he stole patient information from emergency room data sheets that had been thrown in the trash back in August 2011. Memorial HealthCare says that none of the stolen patient records included medical data.  Parsons, Amber Sasha-Rashawn Simmons and Joshua Clayton Thomas then used the data to file online fraudulent 2011 tax returns for 10 former Memorial Healthcare patients and did $818,000 worth of damage. While the patient names weren\u2019t publicized, eerily enough, federal prosecutors did say that the data was stolen from both living and dead patients. Parson was terminated upon the hospital learning of the theft last March.",
