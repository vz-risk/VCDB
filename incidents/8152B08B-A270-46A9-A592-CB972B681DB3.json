The hacker then composed and sent to all hospital employees an email with a link to a YouTube video.

On Oct. 19, 2009, an anonymous hacker using a third IP address allegedly accessed the hospital's website. Using an employee's mailbox, the hacker then allegedly composed and sent an email to all hospital employees accusing more than one of the individual plaintiffs of sexual misconduct and other wrongdoing.
