  "summary": "There was a small health data breach at Shands Jacksonville clinic recently, as Jacksonville.com reports that 261 patients\u2019 names and Social Security numbers were photographed from May 7 to June 19 and given to another person.  The report says Daremia Nikeka Crews was charged Wednesday with \u201cfraudulent use of personal identification information after her cell phone was linked to photos of computer screens that displayed the names.\u201d It took an identity theft sting by State Attorney\u2019s Office, U.S. Secret Service and Internal Revenue Service departments to find the Crews\u2019s phone. Affected patients included those who had been treated at the Brentwood Primary Care Clinic, which is a medical care facility operated by Shands.",
