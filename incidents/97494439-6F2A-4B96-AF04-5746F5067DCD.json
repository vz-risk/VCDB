  "summary": "On February 27, 2013 Chapman University officials learned that certain electronic documents containing personal information could have been viewed by authenticated users of the Chapman University system. These documents were never available to the general public, and only authenticated users of the on-campus network who were logged into the system could have accessed them. As a precautionary measure you are being notified of this matter.  The university\u2019s Department of Information Systems and Technology discovered this vulnerability during standard security testing and the documents were immediately blocked from access by unauthorized users. Some of these documents contained names, social security numbers, student identification numbers and dates of birth.",
