  "summary": "An employee of Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) shared nonpublic voting data in exchange for $15,000 in concert tickets and $20,000 in meals.  From 2007 through early 2012 an ISS employee provided nonpublic information on how over 100 ISS clients were voting on proxy ballots to a firm that gathers shareholder votes.  ISS will pay The Securities and Exchange Commission $300,000 to settle civil charges and penalties.  ISS neither admitted nor denied Securities and Exchange Commission allegations that it violated financial adviser rules designed to prevent misuse of non-public consumer information.",
