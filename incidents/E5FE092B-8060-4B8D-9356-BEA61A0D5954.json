  "summary": "A Montgomery, Maryland clinical social worker self-reported a patient privacy incident that occurred between late in 2012 and early 2013. Kara Falck recently sent a letter to the Baltimore Office of the Attorney General (OAG) that explained why seven clients\u2019 data was exposed due to a vendor\u2019s poor patient privacy procedures.  Falck had been using an Other World Computing (OWC) hard drive to hold patient data (it\u2019s unknown what exactly was on there) for about a month until it stopped working and needed to be returned to OWC on Nov. 28, 2012. While Falck expected the patient data on the device to be wiped clean, OWC ended up selling it to a German doctor named Gerhard Binker with the patient data still viewable. Binker emailed Falck in January to alert her that there was still patient data on the device.",
