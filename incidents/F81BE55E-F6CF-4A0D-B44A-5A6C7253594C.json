Midlothian Council was guilty of five data protection breaches in as many months last year.  In the final incident, on 6 June, a letter about the status of a foster carer was mistakenly added to child protection conference papers and sent to seven professionals who were due to attend that meeting, but who had no right to information about the foster carer.",
