  "summary": "The military says as many as 2,300 patients are affected by a breach of personal information at the Lyster Army Health Clinic at Fort Rucker.  Paper records with the names and Social Security numbers of patients were tossed into a recycling bin at the southeast Alabama base on July 2.  The Army says no medical information was released. But its now sending letters to about 2,300 patients whose identifying information may have been compromised.  A spokeswoman says officials believe the papers were shredded before anyone could see them. The letters are going out to tell patients they can get free fraud monitoring for the next year because of the mistake. ",
