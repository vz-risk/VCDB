  "summary": "This breach impacted one group life insurance customer in Georgia during their open enrollment. Aetna uses a vendor to support the enrollment process. On November 4, 2013, the vendor loaded information related to life insurance beneficiaries incorrectly, which may have resulted in some of the customers employees temporarily viewing the name and social security number of another employees beneficiary. Once identified, the incorrect information was removed from the system and corrected. The vendor identified the employees who had logged into the system during the time period when the incorrect beneficiary information was viewable and may have viewed someone elses beneficiary information.",
