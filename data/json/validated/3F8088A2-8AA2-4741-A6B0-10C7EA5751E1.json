  "summary": "National Credit Adjusters receives certain personal information about reatal customers from retailers that sell us delinquent accounts.  Some customers reported being contacted by certain unauthorized third-party debt collectors.  The personal information that may have been accessed by these unauthorized third-party debt collectors includes names, addresses, debt balances, date of births and Social Security Numbers.  In some instances, the personal information that may have been accessed included the information of individuals who are cosigners on the accounts.    After learning of this incident in March 2014, we conducted an investigation to establish the facts surrounding this incident and notified law enforcement authorities.  Although the investigation is ongoing, we have decided that we cannot at this point rule out the possibility of a breach and are providing you this notice out of an abundance of caution because we wanted to take every precaution to allow you to protect yourself.",
