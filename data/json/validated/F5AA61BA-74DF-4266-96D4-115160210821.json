  "summary": "According to court documents, Guillaume worked for a company that performed medical laboratory tests where he had access to medical records with names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers (personal identity information or PII) of individuals in the course of his employment with that company.  During the conspiracy, Guillaume stole PII from the company and sold five thousand individuals PII to Ponds. Guillaume knew that Ponds would use the PII for the filing of fraudulent and unauthorized tax returns. Ponds caused other individuals to file false and fraudulent tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) seeking refunds using the PII provided by Guillaume. By then, the group had access to the first 24.5 million accounts, in chronological order of creation.",
