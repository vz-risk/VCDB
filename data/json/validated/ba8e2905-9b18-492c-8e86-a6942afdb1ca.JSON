  "summary": "On Friday, Indiana Attorney General, Todd Rokita, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on behalf of the people of Indiana against University of Indiana Health (IU Health) and IU Health Associates, doing business as IU Health Physicians. The 7-count lawsuit alleges the defendants violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and state laws for failing to protect the privacy of a patient.  The patient in question was a 10-year rape victim who sought abortion care at IU Health. The patient and her mother checked into an IU Health-operated hospital on June 29, 2022, to terminate a pregnancy that resulted from the rape. While Indiana has now implemented a near-total ban on abortions following the decision of the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, the termination was provided legally at IU Health before the ban took effect.  The lawsuit relates to a news report in the Indianapolis Star that was printed the day after the termination procedure was performed. The newspaper article included a quote from the girl\u2019s OB/GYN doctor, Dr. Caitlin Bernard. Dr. Bernard did not disclose the patient\u2019s name to the reporter, and the girl\u2019s name was not included in the article. The lawsuit claims HIPAA and state laws were violated because \u201cneither the 10-year-old nor her mother gave the doctor authorization to speak to the media about their case.\u201d",
