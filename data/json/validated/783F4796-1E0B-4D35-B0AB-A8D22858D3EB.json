  "summary": "A Livingston County woman was arrested Wednesday on multiple felony charges after allegedly stealing from the elderly as an in-home caretaker. The investigation began when the Livingston County Sheriff's Office received a call from the supervisor of a company responsible for in-home elderly care. The supervisor had concerns that one of the company's new employees may have stolen and forged a check from her 91-year-old victim. It was also believed that the suspect was making online payments utilizing the victim's checking account to make online purchases. A deputy conducted an investigation which led to the arrest of Ann Rauber, 41, of Dansville. It is alleged that Rauber stole a check from the victim's residence when she was supposed to be caring for her overnight. The check was later forged in the amount of $2,000. Rauber is also accused of recording the victim's routing and bank account numbers from that check. Online purchases and payments were made exceeding $800 by utilizing that information. Rauber was arrested Wednesday and arraigned in Dansville Village Court on charges of second-degree forgery, fourth-degree grand larceny, second-degree identity theft, third-degree identity theft, and petit larceny. Rauber was remanded to Livingston County Jail in lieu of $5,000 cash bail or $10,000 property bond. ",
