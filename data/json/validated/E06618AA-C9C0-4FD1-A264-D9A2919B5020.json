  "summary": "State databases with confidential information from registered voters and driver's licenses in Michigan were not adequately secure and were vulnerable to computer hackers, state auditors said in a report released Friday.  The state elections and technology departments agreed that the systems were vulnerable, but they told the Office of the Auditor General they are not aware of any time information in the Digital Driver's License System and the Qualified Voter File was compromised.  State auditors said the departments of state and information technology did not ensure that an outside contractor effectively secured the Digital Driver's License System, which may lead to identity theft. The system included information from about 7.2 million driver's licenses and 1 million personal identification cards in January 2004.",
