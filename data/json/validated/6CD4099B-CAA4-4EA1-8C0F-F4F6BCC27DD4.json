  "summary": "A burglary at Roark's Pharmacy in Oneida, TN., in January has impacted 3,000 of the store's customers. A hard drive containing customer prescription information and personal data was stolen by thieves who broke in to the pharmacy in the early hours of January 13. The break-in and theft was discovered four hours later when pharmacy owner, Terry Roark, arrived to open the store at 6:30am.  The thieves had taken all of the pharmacy's narcotics, $400 in cash, and a computer hard drive containing the data of 3,000 customers. The thieves are understood to have broken in in order to steal narcotics, and took other items of value, including the hard drive. The thieves gained access to the building by sawing through the door and removing it from its hinges. While law enforcement officers have investigated the burglary and obtained CCTV footage from the service station next door, the DVR system linked to the pharmacy's CCTV cameras was also stolen in the break-in. No suspects have been arrested.",
