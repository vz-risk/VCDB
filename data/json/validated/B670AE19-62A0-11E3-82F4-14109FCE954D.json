  "summary": "At the end of an appointment, a resident wrote the patient's follow up information on the clinic listing and gave it to the patient to turn in to the clerk. This should have been written on the patient's router. The patient walked down the hall with the paper and handed it to the clerk. The patient did not seem to realize what he was carrying but the clerk did not comment on the error or draw attention to it. The list contained the name, appointment time, location, phone number and full SSN of one other patient.",
