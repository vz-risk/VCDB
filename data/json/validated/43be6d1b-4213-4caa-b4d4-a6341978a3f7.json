  "summary": "A former patient of Lee Memorial Hospital says he will sue the health center after an employee photographed him recovering from life-threatening injuries from a motorcycle crash.  The attorney for that patient, Dylan Meracle of Cape Coral, notified the hospital and its operator, Lee Health, of the pending lawsuit this week. In Florida, a plaintiff needs to file an intent to sue notice before filing suit against a government agency.  Meracle lost his left arm in the July crash, suffered two broken legs and spent three weeks in an induced coma at the hospital, he told WINK News. He said a stranger, claiming to be a friend of a hospital nurse, sent him photos of his recovery.",
