  "summary": "The North Texas Comprehensive Spine and Pain Center told 3,000 patients last week of a recent data breach in which it lost a computer drive containing patient medical records back in June.  According to kten.com, the compromised data included names, Social Security number, birthdays, home addresses and diagnoses. Though the organization doesn\u2019t believe that any patient data was used inappropriately, it told patients to check up on their bank accounts and credit reports in case any identities were stolen.",
