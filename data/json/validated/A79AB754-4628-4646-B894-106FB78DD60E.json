  "summary": "Hackers have got their hands on nearly 6,000 private videos of newborn babies and uploaded them to a video-sharing website, according to a Tuesday report by online news outlet Phoenix New Media.  The videos were recorded by the Anhui Women and Children Health Hospital in Hefei, the eastern provincial capital, and were part of a project intended for parents to check in on their hospitalized children.  The hospital posted a message to its WeChat public account on Monday in which they apologized to parents and said they had reported the incident to the police. That post has since been deleted. ",
