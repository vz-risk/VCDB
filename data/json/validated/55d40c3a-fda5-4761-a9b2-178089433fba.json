The breach impacted those who joined the university prior to June, 20, 2019.  \u201cWhile it does not appear that any SFU Computing accounts have been compromised, changing your password now will significantly mitigate that risk,\u201d the letter reads.  It informs people they could be at risk of unsolicited emails or identity theft since student ID numbers, birth dates, full names, course enrolment, email addresses, and encrypted passwords were exposed.  According to the letter, the university came under a ransomware attack that found \u201ca weakness in the way information was handled.\u201d",
