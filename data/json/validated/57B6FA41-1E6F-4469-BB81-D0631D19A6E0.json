  "summary": "A Cape Coral registered nurse was arrested and accused of exploiting some of her patients ranging in age from 65 to 92, according to the Lee County Sheriff's Office.  Lynn Schlosser is charged with criminal use of personal information, identification theft and exploitation of the elderly.  She is married to someone a sheriff's office employee, which makes her exempt from having her mug shot appear on the jail's website. Her husband was placed on administrative leave.  Deputies were first alerted to the crimes on January 5, 2015. They determined Schlosser, who was working as a home health care RN for the victims, was a suspect.  Investigators went through Schlosser's patient list and found she had opened fraudulent credit card accounts in the names of at least eight patients.  Victim Geraldine Robbins said she knew something was wrong when she kept getting rejection letters from banks over credit accounts she never tried to open.  Deputies say evidence found on Schlosser's home computers also linked her to the crimes.  Investigators say she used the fraudulent accounts to buy iPads, DVDs and gift cards.  Robbins even got a $1,400 bill from a car repair shop after Schlosser opened an account there under her name.  The company Schlosser worked for, Medical Services of America, described the incident as \"unfortunate\" and said they would offer free credit monitoring services to the victims as appropriate.  Schlosser's attorney would not comment on the case.",
