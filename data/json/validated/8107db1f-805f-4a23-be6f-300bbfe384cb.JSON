The company stated it is still investigating the root causes of the incident and whether attackers accessed company data. Asahi has begun accepting some orders and resumed shipments, with plans to open phone lines for customer input next week.  The attack, which began Monday, has dominated Japanese headlines and sparked concerns about potential shortages of the country\u2019s popular Asahi Super Dry beer. Major retailers including Seven & i Holdings Co. have warned customers about possible beer shortages, while convenience store chains Lawson Inc. and Familymart Co. indicated that Asahi products, including food and other beverages, might become scarce starting Friday.\"",
