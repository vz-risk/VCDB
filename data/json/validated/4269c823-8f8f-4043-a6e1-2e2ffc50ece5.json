  "summary": "An investigation started after an employee's email account was compromised on June 22 in a phishing scam, officials said.   The employee notified the IT department the following day, which prompted the hospital to investigate whether any personal information could have been accessed.  On July 7, Community Memorial said, it discovered the email account contained personal information, and that finding started an additional review by a forensic consultant. The consultant later determined that it was unlikely any personal information was accessed.",
