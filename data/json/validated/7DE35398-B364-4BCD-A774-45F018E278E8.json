  "summary": "CHAMPVA spouse of Veteran alleged that her medical records were inappropriately released to former husband.  The female patient informed the PO that she has updated her medical and demographic record to reflect change of address, phone number & that she is now separated. The PO met with the ROI staff, who stated that the spouse said that the female was confined to bed for the past five years and that he was her sole\ncaregiver. He stated on the 10-5345a release form that the information was needed for a SSA claim.  Education has been provided to the ROI staff by the PO, to prevent reoccurrence. The PO has entered a Disclosure Alert in the record in DSS/ROI. The female has  requested and has been provided copies of the signed consents we have on file to review the signatures for authenticity and she has been informed of the OIG and\nits services, in the event she chooses to pursue any further action.",
