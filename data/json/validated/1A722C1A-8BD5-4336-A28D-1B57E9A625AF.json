  "summary": "Flamingo Resort and Spa is notifying all current and former employees after they discovered that a virus on the payroll computer might have allowed a hacker to access their personal information, including Social Security number, date of birth, address, phone number, and for those used direct deposit, bank routing numbers. The virus was discovered within the past month, but the notification letter does not disclose when the virus first infected the computer.  Employees of the Santa Rosa, California hotel and conference center were advised to place a fraud alert on their credit files and to take some precautions, but the letter from Christine Melton in Human Resources and Floriann Bynum, General Manager, did not offer them any free credit monitoring services.",
