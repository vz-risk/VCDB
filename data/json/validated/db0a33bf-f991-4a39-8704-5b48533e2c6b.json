  "summary": "For the second time this year, a fitness app is to blame for revealing the locations of people working at military bases, intelligence agencies and other sensitive sites, as well as pinpointing those users\u2019 homes.  The fitness app Polar Flow allows users to share the GPS locations of where they are exploring \u2014 aka exercising; that\u2019s supposedly a feature and not a flaw. Yet the API could be queried to reveal users\u2019 fitness activities, their locations, their homes \u2014 as it is often where people would turn on and later off the tracking when beginning and ending a workout. Further, some additional sleuthing revealed even users\u2019 names.",
