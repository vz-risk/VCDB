  "summary": "Safeway Inc. agreed to pay nearly $10 million after a two-year investigation revealed that the Pleasanton-based company was improperly disposing of hazardous materials like medications and batteries as well as customers medical records, prosecutors said Monday. The $9.87 million settlement  which closes a case built on surprise inspections of Safeway dumpsters in 2012 and 2013  was approved Friday by Alameda County Superior Court Judge Wynne Carvill. Safeway admitted no wrongdoing, but said it will beef up training to avoid future problems. The company was accused by several counties of violations at more than 500 stores and distribution centers it operated in California, including stores under the brand names Vons, Pavilions and Pak N Save, said Alameda County Assistant District Attorney Ken Mifsud, one of the lead attorneys in the case.  Safeways disposal practices raised concern in 2012, Mifsud said, when district attorneys from San Joaquin and Orange counties conducted an investigation into a different business and found that Safeway was illegally shipping hazardous materials back to its distribution centers. That in and of itself is illegal, he said. Hazardous waste needs to handled by licensed transporters, and it needs to be properly labeled. None of that was happening. Based on that discovery, Mifsud said, prosecutors began the waste inspections at stores across the state. Investigators found that, on top of shipping waste back to distribution centers, Safeway workers were tossing potentially hazardous materials into common dumpsters and disposing of medical records from pharmacies  which contained patients names, phone numbers and addresses  without shredding them, putting customers at risk of identity theft. Mifsud said he did not know what protocols the company had in place in the past to deal with disposal of sensitive customer information and hazardous materials. Before 2012, there are years where its likely that large amounts of these materials were improperly disposed of, he said. Between 2012 and Fridays settlement, he said, district attorneys from across the state worked with Safeway to bring the company into compliance, creating procedures to ensure that materials are disposed of properly. Beyond the monetary civil penalties, the settlement also mandates that the company continue its First Assistant Store Manager Program, which addresses compliance at the store level, and conduct yearly store audits. If you take shortcuts that pollute our environment there will be consequences, said San Francisco District Attorney George Gasc_n. Judgments like these are a reminder to companies everywhere that we will vigorously pursue violations that threaten the environment. Safeway said Monday that it has strengthened policies to deal with disposal of hazardous materials like detergents, aerosol sprays, hair dye, antibacterial soaps and mascara. We have enhanced these programs and added new and supplementary training to ensure strict adherence to the law and to our policies, the company said. Safeway will continue to dedicate significant resources to these important programs. We are committed to helping to protect our environment. Safeway sold itself in March to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management for more than $9 billion. Safeway is merging with Albertsons, and the two companies are divesting 168 stores in California and seven other states in order to satisfy Federal Trade Commission demands.",
