  "summary": "We learned on April 3, 2013 that an unknown person gained access to your account on our website by using your e-mail address and PIN. The unknown person then attempted to order an item from QVC using your stored credit card information. The credit card that you associated with your QVC account was not charged, and the unknown person was not able to see your credit card number (only the last four digits are visible). The unknown person may have viewed other information associated with your account, including your name, address, e-mail address, and transaction history. We cancelled the order and closed the account.",
