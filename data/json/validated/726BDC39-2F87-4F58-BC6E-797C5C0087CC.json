  "summary": "A few days ago, I noticed a new member registered with a red user ID (administrator), and soon after, another one. I contacted Edward, and he had found out about a hack in the VBulletin software that runs WNY. The accounts were deleted, and it appears no harm was done.  However, an administrator has access to member account information, including passwords. Although he can no longer damage the overall forum, he can sign in as an existing member, and cause problems.  It would be wise for every member to change their password.",
