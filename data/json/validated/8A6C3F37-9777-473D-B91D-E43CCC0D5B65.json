  "summary": "A woman who went to St. Peter's Hospital in Helena after an alleged a rape is suing the hospital and a pharmacist, saying they violated her medical privacy.  The woman told authorities last year she was raped by Andrew Stevick back in January 2015.  He's admitted to criminal endangerment in the case and was sentenced last week to spending 24 hours in jail every month for the next three years.  On the day of the incident, the woman sought care at St. Peter's Hospital, according to the lawsuit, filed January 6 in District Court in Helena by attorney John Doubek.  The lawsuit says James \"Jim\" Stevick worked at the hospital and improperly accessed her medical records.  Jim Stevick is a licensed pharmacist; the woman says he's the father of Andrew Stevick.  In the lawsuit, the woman says she made very clear to medical staff that she was concerned that Jim Stevick was working there and might breach her medical confidentiality.  A woman answering the phone at Jim Stevick's home declined comment Wednesday.  St. Peter's wouldn't comment on the active litigation.  A spokeswoman wrote in an email that Jim Stevick doesn't work there now, but the hospital does not confirm or deny any past employment.  St. Peter's also says it has zero tolerance for patient privacy violations.  It says it does vigorous monitoring and random audits to ensure privacy and immediately terminates any violators.",
