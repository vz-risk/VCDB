  "summary": "We are writing to inform you of an incident that may have involved your personal information. Dun & Bradstreet (D&B), a provider of business information, recently learned that it was one of several victims of a criminal cyberattack. Based on our investigation of the incident to date, we believe the attack primarily occurred during a fifteen (15)day period in March and April 2013 and potentially resulted in unauthorized access to our environment, including one of our commercial information databases. The potentially exposed information is generally available from public sources. In some circumstances this information may have included certain personal information provided in a business context. This letter has not been delayed by a law enforcement investigation. D&B is actively investigating the matter and is working with law enforcement. We have identified you as one of the individuals whose personal information may be at risk. Based on the facts known to the company at this time, the personal information in the database included your name and a business identification number that may have also been your social security number.",
