  "summary": "During a visit to San Francisco On June 27 my car was broken into and my computer stolen, along with camera, suitcases, and other equipment. The computer was an older office desktop I planned to give to my brother. It was hidden in the trunk. The computer contained patient names, dates of birth, some phone numbers, and clinical notes, and e-mails. Addresses, social security numbers, and insurance information were not stored on the stolen computer. Fortunately, the clinical notes were protected by two passwords, and were maintained in a format unique to the software used to prepare them. The software program itself was not on the computer, making the data almost impossible to decipher. E-mail information was password protected, and generally contained laboratory reports, some reports from outside health care providers, and e-mails sent to the office by our patients. ",
