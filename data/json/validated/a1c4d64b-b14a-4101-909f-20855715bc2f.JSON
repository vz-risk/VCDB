  "summary": "On June 28, 2023, Citi Trends, Inc. filed a notice of data breach with the Attorney General of Montana after discovering that an unauthorized party was able to access confidential employee information stored on the company\u2019s IT network. In this notice, Citi Trends explains that the incident resulted in an unauthorized party being able to access consumers\u2019 sensitive information, which includes their names, Social Security numbers and financial account information. Upon completing its investigation, Citi Trends began sending out data breach notification letters to all individuals whose information was affected by the recent data security incident.  The Citi Trends data breach was only recently announced, and more information is expected in the near future. However, Citi Trends\u2019 filing with the Attorney General of Montana provides some important information on what led up to the breach. According to this source, around January 14, 2023, Citi Trends was the target of a cyberattack. In response, Citi Trends blocked all unauthorized access to its computer network and then launched an investigation with the help of outside cybersecurity experts.  As a result of this investigation, Citi Trends determined that an unauthorized party was able to access its network, including files that contained confidential information relating to employees and prospective employees.  After learning that sensitive employee data was accessible to an unauthorized party, Citi Trends reviewed the compromised files to determine what information was leaked and which consumers were impacted. While the breached information varies depending on the individual, it may include your name, Social Security number and financial account information.   On June 21, 2023, Citi Trends sent out data breach letters to anyone who was affected by the recent data security incident. These letters should provide victims with a list of which information of theirs was compromised.",
