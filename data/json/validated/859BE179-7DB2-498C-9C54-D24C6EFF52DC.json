The list did not include medical information or dates of birth.  The second list was of patients in the provider's panel that are on opioids. This list identified 70 Veterans' full name, full Social Security Number, date of birth, opioid prescription nomenclature, and last time ordered.  After review and analysis, the VA determined that 70 Veterans would be sent a letter offering credit protection services, while a HIPAA notification letter would be sent to 141 Veterans due to Protected Health Information (PHI) being disclosed.",
