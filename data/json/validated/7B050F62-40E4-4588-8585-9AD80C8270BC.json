The announcement comes at a time when large-scale attacks on cloud CRM systems have already shaken tech and retail sectors alike, with Salesforce clients such as Google, Allianz and Dior reporting similar intrusions. These earlier incidents exposed names, emails and phone numbers, which were sufficient for attackers to launch phishing campaigns or extortion attempts.\"",
