  "summary": "HR assistant stated that the civilian army record of a new employee was requested from the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) so HR could give appropriate work history credit, pay etc. Record was requested in August and never received. HR finally notified on 2/27/13 the record was sent by USPS to this facility but not via any tracking mechanism where someone would have to sign for the package. HR assistant reported to PO today of various attempts to locate record without success. PO made recommendations of other areas within facility to check in the meantime of possible locations where record could have been delivered to in error. Because record has not been found and it contains a high volume of PII, SSN, full name, home address, credentialing information etc. it is recommended for credit monitoring since it has not been determined definitively that it was received at this facility.",
