Complainant alleged his ex wife and her clinical providers accessed and inappropriately documented in his medical record. An investigation was completed and did confirm complainant's ex wife/VA employee did indeed access his medical record over 260 times. The investigation also confirmed the provider (MH ARNP) of the complainant's ex wife accessed his medical record and documented the personal legal history of her patient and the complainant. During the course of the investigation, it was also verbally revealed, the ARNP provided documentation and testimony to the court about the complainant on behalf of his ex wife. This was completed without the approval of local Regional Counsel and without the proper authorization forms.\nA record review was completed by the HIMS Chief and the notes completed by the ARNP was found to have no relation to treatment and therefore should not be part of the medical record.",
