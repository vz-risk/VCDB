  "summary": "Veteran A contacted the Portland VA's Transplant department to complain that his health information had been emailed without his authorization to his Aunt on December 9, 2011. He is currently being evaluated as a potential organ donor for Veteran B who is a relative. The Aunt is a potential donor as well. The Veteran faxed the transplant department a copy of the email his Aunt had received. The facility Privacy Officer was contacted by a transplant employee and given the fax.\nThe email contains approximately 11 lines of text that were copy and pasted from a Nov 9, 2011 note in the Veteran A's VA medical record with additional\ncomments added. This email could not have been sent encrypted as the recipient address was not within the VA mail system.The first and last names of Veteran\nA, Veteran B, and the Aunt are included in the email, but no other identifiers were included.",
