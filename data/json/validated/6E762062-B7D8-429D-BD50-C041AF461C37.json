  "summary": "UCLA Health announced Tuesday that 1,242 patients are being notified about the theft of a faculty member's laptop computer containing names, medical record numbers and health information used to prepare patient treatment plans.  According to UCLA, no Social Security numbers, health plan ID numbers, credit card numbers or other financial data were stored on the stolen laptop, which was password protected and was reported stolen on July 3.  UCLA Health officials said they immediately initiated an analysis of a backup disk made available by the faculty member -- whose name was not released -- to determine whether protected health or other restricted information was stored on the laptop and, if so, who was affected.  The review was completed on Aug. 14.  \"At this time, there is no evidence that any individual's personal or medical information stored on the laptop has been accessed, disclosed or used,\" according to a UCLA Health statement. \"UCLA Health has policies and programs in place to identify 'red flags' or warnings of possible medical identity theft and inform patients when these are found.\" ",
