  "summary": "Jane Doe, a single mother living in Brooklyn, asked LAC for help when a Kings County Hospital employee illegally disclosed her HIV status following her hospitalization.  The employee had no role in Jane Does care, but recognized Jane because she and the employees son socialized.  The employee searched the hospitals electronic records without permission, learned Janes HIV status, and told her son.  He then told his friends, and together, they harassed and threatened Jane with a pit bull.  Jane was so fearful for the safety of herself and her daughter that she got a protective order.  She also wanted some measure of justice, so LAC filed and successfully settled a lawsuit on Janes behalf, with the pro bono support of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.",
