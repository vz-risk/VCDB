  "summary": "Game publisher Ubisoft was breached and unauthorized parties accessed customers\u2019 usernames, e-mail addresses and hashed passwords. Ubisoft urges all account owners to change their passwords at once.  The French firm emailed its customers, informing them that \u201ccredentials were stolen and used to illegally access our online network\u201d giving unauthorized people access to users\u2019 accounts. No further details on the attack were given.  Currently all compromised systems are closed off and the company is working to restore them.  According to the email, no financial information was reached since Ubisoft has a payment processing company handle money-related data. \u201cPlease note that no personal payment information is stored with Ubisoft, meaning your debit/credit card information was safe from this intrusion\u201d the e-mail reads.  \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, we also recommend that you change your password on any other Web site or service where you use the same or a similar password.\u201d",
