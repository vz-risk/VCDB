  "summary": "\"A data breach at an unnamed French hospital exposed the medical records of 750,000 patients after a threat actor gained access to its electronic patient record system.\n\nA threat actor using the nickname 'nears' (previously near2tlg) claimed to have attacked multiple healthcare facilities in France, alleging that they have access to the patient records of over 1,500,000 people.\n\nThe hacker claims they breached MediBoard by Software Medical Group, a company offering Electronic Patient Record (EPR) solutions across Europe. Softway Medical Group has confirmed that hackers have compromised a MediBoard account. However, it noted that this was not the result of a software vulnerability or misconfiguration on their part, but rather through the use of stolen credentials used by the hospital.\"",
