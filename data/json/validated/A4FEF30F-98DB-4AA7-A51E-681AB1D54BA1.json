  "summary": "A nurse from the Psych ER called the Privacy Office letting the Privacy Officer (PO) know that an employee from Edible Arrangements called stating that they got medical information faxed to them on a Veteran that comes to the VA for treatment.  Our doctor stated that he was told by a staff at outside facility to fax the paperwork to another number since the regular fax number was not working at the time.\nWhen doctor called back to the facility and attempted to discuss case, he was told that they did not receive any documents, and then he found out that the temporary fax number he had received was wrong 2of the last 4 number was mixed up. The doctor stated that he did not think that the fax had actually gone through, so that he took no further action. He said that even after he received the correct temporary fax number, he decided not to fax any more documents to a temporary number due to a possible risk of sending them to a wrong place.",
