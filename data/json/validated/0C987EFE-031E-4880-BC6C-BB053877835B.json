  "summary": " Anchor Bank is offering an apology to nearly 200 customers who were sent the wrong mortgage statements.  Janesville railroad engineer Joe Martin says he received a March statement that should have been sent to a Madison couple. Martin tells WISC-TV that he's concerned his statement ended up in the wrong hands.  Anchor Bank spokeswoman Jennifer Ranville says a mailroom malfunction is to blame for the problem. The statements included loan information, but did not include checking, saving or Social Security numbers. The Madison bank is offering one year of fraud protection to those affected. ",
