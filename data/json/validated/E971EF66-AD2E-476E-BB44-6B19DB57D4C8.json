  "summary": "While VA Police were conducting security checks of the exterior buildings, they encountered a man going through a shredding container behind an out building. The man fled off campus when he saw the Police. It is unknown if the suspect fled with any items from the containers. The Police stated that the bin contained contracts, emails and patient information.  03/20/12:\nThe VA Police originally reported that less than 50 documents were in the shred bin, but after the Privacy Officer reviewed them, she found individually identifiable information for 126 Veterans. Some of these documents have names, full SSNs and dates of birth. Others have names and last four of SSN or names and address. The VA Police notified OIG who declined the case. There are no cameras that view the area where the shred bin was. The shred bin was not locked and was not supposed to be located outside.\n03/30/12:\nThe final counts are 130 Veterans with full SSN disclosed and 13 Veterans with only name and address on the documents. The 130 will be offered credit protection services and the 13 will be sent letters of notification.\n04/25/12:\nOn further investigation, the bin was actually a recycle bin, not a shred bin. The employee placed it incorrectly in the recycle bin.",
