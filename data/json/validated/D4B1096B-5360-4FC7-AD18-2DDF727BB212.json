  "summary": "Durham Employee A contacted United Services Automobile Association (USAA) concerning a potential loan. Employee A was notified by USAA that she was listed as the co-signer on a loan that was in default. She was further notified that the primary person on the loan was Durham Employee B. Employee A is a Veteran with a record in CPRS. Employee A believes that Employee B used the VA information system to access Employee As sensitive information. A Vista report run by the Information Security Officer (ISO) confirms that Employee B accessed the record of Employee A on 10/20/09 and on 10/28/10. Employee A contacted her immediate supervisors, the Information Security Officer and the VA Police to report this issue. VA Police are currently investigating this incident to determine its validity. While the investigation is ongoing, the information system access for Employee B has been disabled until the extent of the incident can be determined.",
