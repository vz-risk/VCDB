  "summary": "A Pathways Professional Counseling employee's laptop was stolen on September 24, 2015, potentially exposing 986 individuals' information. The theft was discovered the very next day, and Pathways immediately notified local law enforcement.  The device was password protected, according to a company statement, but has not yet been recovered.  Exposed information may include an individual's name combined with one or more of the following data elements: Social Security number, date of birth, address, treating physician name, diagnosis and clinical information, phone number, email address, demographic information, financial information, health insurance information, treatment information, and medication information.      The data breach notification process was delayed because of a request by local law enforcement, Pathways explained.  The laptop's network connection capabilities have been terminated, the employee's access credentials were changed, and it was confirmed that the system has not been accessed by the device in question \"since the employee's last valid access the afternoon before the laptop was stolen.\"",
