  "summary": "Anonymous released a video to reveal their intentions of targeting online game websites that fail to properly protect their customers. To show they\u2019re serious, they already breached a website and leaked tons of information from its databases.  \u201cMany users of the Internet actively playing online games, but none of the seller cares about privacy,\u201d Anonymous states.  Their first victim is a German website, owned by RandyRun, called Wow-Gold.de.  Even though the website claims to be protected by McAfee, baring the McAfee Secure trustmark to prove it, Anonymous hackers say they didn\u2019t have any trouble breaching their security and leaking private information such as names, dates of birth, email addresses, phone numbers and even passwords.",
