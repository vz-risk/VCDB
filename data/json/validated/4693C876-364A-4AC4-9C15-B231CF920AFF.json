  "summary": "An unencrypted desktop computer that contained the electronic protected health information (ePHI) of 670 individuals was stolen from the covered entity (CE), NYU Langone Medical Center.  The ePHI included names, diagnoses, the results of diagnostic tests, and clinical information.  Upon discovery of the breach, the CE filed a police report and provided breach notification to HHS, the media, and affected individuals.  As a result of OCRs investigation, the CE directed staff to store ePHI on network servers and not on desktops.  In addition, the CE improved physical security by installing a locking device to secure the desktop computer and a latch guard on the office door.  The CE retrained all staff on its policies and procedures for HIPAA and HITECH compliance.",
