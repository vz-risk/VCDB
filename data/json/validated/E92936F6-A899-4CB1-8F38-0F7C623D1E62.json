The forms did not include details of the ailment.Something went wrong when the file was being compiled and the information was wrongly linked to the address list, director of customer services Annemiek Heijer told Radio 1 news. The mistake, she said, is down to human error. In total, 2643 people were sent the forms  a patient satisfaction survey  using someone elses details.",
