  "summary": "Baptist Primary Care is sending out hundreds of warnings to patients after a former worker was caught with private patient records. It's an alert patients didn't want to get: Their personal identity found in a former Baptist employee's car. Action News was first tipped off to the potential security breach on a Facebook forum. A woman said she received a letter from Baptist Primary Care detailing that 13 files were found in the hands of that former employee just last month. The woman also wrote that her identity had recently been stolen. A Baptist spokesperson told Action News the files were found in a former employee's car during a traffic stop in Georgia.   Baptist said that's why it sent out more than a thousand letters to patients. So far, they know names, birth dates and Social Security numbers of the 13 patients were all compromised.  Attorney Randy Reep said that's all a thief needs to steal someone's identity. \"It's not just stealing from a person and their reputation, it's their good name, their credit,\" said Reep. Baptist said all of the files were accessed sometime in 2011. But Reep said even information stolen three years ago can still be used to take advantage of patients today. \"It doesn't happen quickly. It may be tomorrow. It may be five years from now,\" said Reep.",
