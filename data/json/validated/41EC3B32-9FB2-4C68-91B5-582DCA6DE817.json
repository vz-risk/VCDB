Veteran A was seen at the VA Maine Healthcare System for a procedure, which was correctly documented in the patient's chart. However, it was Veteran B who was billed for this procedure, and who was sent a patient communication in the form of an appointment reminder. Veteran B returned this incorrectly mailed information to the VA Maine Healthcare System Privacy Officer (PO). The information at risk was Veteran B's name, address and diagnosis.",
