  "summary": "The Veterans Affairs hospital in Fayetteville says documents containing the personal information of nearly 1,100 veterans were found in a recycling bin two months ago.  The Fayetteville VA Medical Center announced Friday its notifying the 1,093 affected veterans whose consultation reports from the optical shop were incorrectly placed in a recycle bin over a three-month period. The documents found April 17 contained patients names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses and prescriptions.  Officials say theres no indication the information has been misused. But the hospital is notifying veterans who visited the optical shop between Jan. 11 and April 16 and offering them free credit monitoring services.  The hospital says the staff member who had been collecting the documents was retrained on what items should be shredded.",
