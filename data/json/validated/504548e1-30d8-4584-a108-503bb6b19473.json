  "summary": "A MasterChef finalist has recovered half of the $250,000 she had stolen while settling her house using Australia\u2019s new online conveyancing system, but she and her family could still be left without a home to live in.  The theft has left the system's operators scrambling to close down security flaws.  The former MasterChef contestant, Dani Venn, and her husband Chris Burgess were left homeless last week when $250,000 from the settlement of her recently sold Melbourne property was stolen by hackers who set up third party accounts to breach the fledgling electronic property transfer system Property Exchange Australia (PEXA).  Ms Venn\u2019s bank, the Commonwealth Bank, was able to freeze $138,000 of the funds, but the hackers who entered the system via her conveyancer\u2019s account made off with the remainder.  \u201cThe $110,000 is missing and it\u2019s not recoverable,\u201d she said.",
