  "summary": "On November 20, 2013, Auburn University became aware of a compromised server within the College of Business network. Auburn immediately patched the vulnerability and launched an internal investigation to determine the scope of the attack. When it became clear that this incident could result in the unauthorized access to personal information, Auburn University hired an independent, third-party computer forensics expert to assist in identifying the full extent of data potentially exposed as a result of this incident.  The unidentified hacker could have accessed the server between October 21, 2013 and November 20, 2014. The FBI has been notified of this incident, and investigations are ongoing.  Personal information relating to 13,698 individuals was identified on the compromised server. The information on this server varies by person but mainly pertained to courses being taken by current and former Auburn students and work performed by current and former faculty and staff. Auburn has no evidence that the files containing personal information were actually accessed and is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of this personal information. The university is offering each person affected one free year of credit monitoring and identity theft protection services with Experian.",
