  "summary": "More than 6,000 patients of Beachwood-Westlake Plastic Surgery and Medical Spa in Ohio are being notified that their personal information was on computer hardware that was stolen during an office burglary.  How many victims? 6,141, according to HHS.gov.   What type of personal information? Names and limited medical information.  What happened? Computer hardware that stored the personal information was stolen during a burglary on the Beachwood-Westlake Plastic Surgery and Medical Spa office.  What was the response? All impacted patients are being notified, and offered a free year of credit monitoring services.  Details: The burglary occurred on June 29. Beachwood-Westlake Plastic Surgery and Medical Spa has a security and surveillance system in place, but a cleaning crew failed to reactivate the system on the night of the crime.  Quote: The Beachwood police have informed us that they believe this hardware was taken because it can back-up office security systems, and it is unlikely the perpetrators purposefully stole any personal information, Jessica Morris, practice manager for Dr. Steven Goldman, wrote in the notification posted to the website.
