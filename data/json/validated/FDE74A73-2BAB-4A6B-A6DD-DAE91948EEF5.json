  "summary": "Complaints are still incoming about the breach of the credit card system at Natural Provisions on Harvest Lane earlier this year, police said.  Detective Sgt. Bart Chamberlain said most complaints were filed between May and early July, but are still incoming.  The credit card data was then used to create fraudulent credit cards that have been used to purchase goods and services all over the United States and in several foreign countries, Chamberlain said in a news release.  It is unknown whether it was one or more people that obtained the credit card data, but it is believed the information was obtained through an Internet connection on one or more point of sale machines.",
