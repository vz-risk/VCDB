  "summary": "Sunshine Behavioral Health, LLC is a private network of drug and alcohol addiction treatment facilities with locations in California, Texas, and Colorado. At some time as yet unknown to DataBreaches.net, approximately 93,000 patient files related to billings for patients at their Monarch Shore, Chapters Capistrano, and Willow Springs Recovery facilities were exposed online due to a misconfiguration of an Amazon AWS s3 bucket.  DataBreaches.net notes that the approximately 93,000 files did not represent 90,000 unique patients, as for many patients, there was more than one file, and not all files were actual files (some appeared to be templates or test data).",
