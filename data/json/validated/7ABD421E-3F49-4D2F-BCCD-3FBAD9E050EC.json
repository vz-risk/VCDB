  "summary": "A San Francisco Bay area postal worker accused of stealing thousands of pieces of mail to obtain credit cards has been sentenced to 18 months in jail.  Attorneys tell the San Mateo County Times (http://bit.ly/ZdKHGG) that 39-year-old Romeo Natan has credit for about 10 months in jail and will likely serve the rest of his sentence in a residential drug treatment program. He was sentenced on Tuesday.  Natan pleaded no contest in January to one felony count each of identity theft, fraud and burglary. Attorneys say he targeted credit cards and mail going through San Carlos to feed a methamphetamine habit.  A telegram from 1938 was among the thousands of pieces of mail Natan was caught with. A Daly City police detective helped get the telegram to its rightful owners.",
