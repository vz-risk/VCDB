  "summary": "\"Several dermatology practices have recently announced data breaches following an attack on their management company. The number of attacks reported this year by dermatology practices suggests they are being targeted by one or more threat actors.\n\nIn May 2025, DermCare Management, a Florida-based company that provides support services for dermatologists and dermatology specialists, notified the HHS\u2019 Office for Civil Rights (OCR) about a network server hacking/IT incident, using a placeholder estimate of 501 affected individuals as the number of affected individuals had yet to be established. Several of the affected practices have now issued substitute breach notifications about the incident.\n\nDermCare Management has more than 60 locations in Florida, Texas, California, and Virginia, and primarily provides services related to platform building and development, revenue growth, operational improvement, and improving the patient experience. At least 10 practices are known to have been affected. The list of affected providers is not exhaustive and mostly consists of practices in Florida. Further practices may announce that they have been affected in the coming days and weeks. None of the practices below are currently listed on the HHS\u2019 Office for Civil Rights breach portal, so it is unclear how many individuals have been affected.\nConfirmed Affected Practices\n\nMiami Plastic Surgery, Florida\nKeys Dermatology, Florida\nHollywood Dermatology, Florida\nJacksonville Beach Dermatology, Florida\nSkin Center of South Miami, Florida\nFlorida West Coast Skin Center, Florida\nDania Dermatology, Florida\nFlorida Academic Dermatology Center, Florida\nRendon Center, Florida\nDermatology Treatment and Research Center, Texas\"\nAccording to the substitute breach notices on the websites of the above practices, the attack was identified on February 26, 2025. Suspicious network activity was identified, and networks were rapidly secured. The investigation confirmed on March 3, 2025, that patient information may have been copied from the network. Files are still being reviewed to determine the number of affected individuals and the types of data involved; however, the compromised information likely includes names, Social Security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, financial account information, medical information, and health insurance information. The affected individuals have been advised to remain vigilant against identity theft and fraud by monitoring their account statements and free credit reports.\n\n\"\"",
