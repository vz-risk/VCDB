  "summary": "The Florida Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) today reported an information security breach to FDLE, due to the possibility of identity theft.   On Jan. 2, DJJ reported the theft of a mobile device containing youth and employee records to the Tallahassee Police Department (TPD), which is currently investigating the theft. DJJ has also notified the Office of Information Security.   The device, which was stolen from a secure DJJ office, was not encrypted or password-protected as required by DJJs technology policy.   This is an unacceptable lapse that could potentially expose youth and employees to identity theft, stated Secretary Wansley Walters. We are working to determine who may be affected by the breach and make sure that all other devices with confidential information are properly protected. We are partnering with TPD to track down the stolen device and have reached out to FDLE.   DJJ confirms that more than 100,000 records may have been compromised, and the agency is currently working to determine the affected individuals. DJJ is working to notify those youth and employees who may be affected, once they are determined.  DJJ issued emails with a policy reminder and prospective security instructions to all employees and contracted provider programs requiring the immediate encryption of all mobile devices that are not already protected and contain confidential data.
