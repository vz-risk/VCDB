  "summary": "Even with strong administrative safeguards and comprehensive firewalls, a health data breach can occur if employees at an organization are careless with computers and portable devices that store sensitive information.  Visionworks, a subsidiary of Pennsylvania-based health insurer Highmark Inc., is learning that lesson as it faces a potential data breach after a computer server went missing from an Annapolis store. The server was replaced on June 2, 2014 during schedule upgrades, according to a Visionworks statement. However, it is believed that the server was sent to one of the stores landfills along with other miscellaneous refuse.  The server potentially held partially unencrypted protected health information (PHI) belonging to as many as 75,000 customers, the statement read. Customer credit card information that was stored on the server was encrypted, Visionworks said, and therefore should not be at risk. Moreover, Social Security numbers were not included in the server.  The company is currently in the process of notifying customers potentially affected and offering them free credit monitoring, Lisa Martinelli, the chief privacy officer for Highmark Health, told PennLive.  The server in question was replaced during a store remodeling that began in June, Martinelli said. The device was reportedly being stored at the location, but when Visionworks recently initiated a recall of the server to have its data erase, it was found to be missing. However, Martinelli added that there is low probability of harm resulting from the loss.",
