  "summary": "A notorious group of hackers blamed for recent breaches on major casino companies is also suspected of being behind a recent cyberattack against Clorox Co. that has led to a nationwide shortage of its cleaning products.  Officials suspect that \u201cScattered Spider\u201d is responsible for a breach that Clorox first disclosed in August, according to four people familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified because the information isn\u2019t public. The same group, known for its so-called social engineering tactics, was tied to attacks on Caesars Entertainment Inc. and MGM Resorts International in recent weeks, Bloomberg News previously reported.  in a statement, Clorox said fiscal first-quarter net sales will decrease by as much as 28% from a year ago because of the cyberattack, while organic sales \u2014 which strip out currency changes, acquisitions and divestitures \u2014 are expected to fall as much as 26%.",
