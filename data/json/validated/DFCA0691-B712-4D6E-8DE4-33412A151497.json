  "summary": "\"The University of Phoenix became the latest U.S. educational institution to warn employees of a data breach involving a popular line of business software from Oracle.\n\nThe university\u2019s parent company filed a notice with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday evening saying \u201cnumerous individuals\u201d tied to the organization had information accessed by hackers who breached the Oracle E-Business Suite software platform.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the private, for-profit school was listed on the leak site of a prominent Russian extortion group that allegedly breached dozens of organizations through a vulnerability in the Oracle platform, including Harvard University, Dartmouth College and the University of Pennsylvania. \n\nAt the time, a University of Phoenix spokesperson told Recorded Future News that it was investigating the incident. \n\nIn the SEC filing on Tuesday, the school said it detected the incident on November 21 and discovered that the hackers breached systems in August, gaining access to the names, contact information, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and bank account and routing numbers of an unstated number of people.\"",
