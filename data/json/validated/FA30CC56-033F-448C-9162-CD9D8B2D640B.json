  "summary": "A laptop carried by an employee of an EMC subsidiary has been reported stolen by Hartford Hospital, compromising the personal health records of about 9,000 patients, the Connecticut Attorney General's Office reports.  According to a news release from Nutmeg State Attorney General George Jepsen, the data breach involved \"unencrypted personal information and protected health information\" of about 9,000 patients, stored on a laptop used by an employee of Greenplum, an EMC Corp. (NYSE: EMC) subsidiary.  The compromised data includes names, addresses, dates of birth, marital status, Social Security numbers, Medicaid and Medicare numbers and medical record numbers, as well as some diagnosis and treatment information.  Hartford Hospital discovered the laptop's theft in June. It has been reported to police and is under investigation, according to Jepsen's office.  The employee was working on a quality improvement project related to hospital readmissions. The compromised data include records of 2,097 Hartford Hospital patients and 7,461 patients of VNA Healthcare Inc., a Connecticut home hospice services operator.  San Mateo, Calif.-based Greenplum was acquired by EMC in 2010 and forms the foundation for the Hopkinton, Mass.-based data storage giant's big data division.",
