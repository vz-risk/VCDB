  "summary": "Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been accused of breaching patient confidentiality by tweeting a photo to his 70,000 followers from a hospital visit.  He came under fire after the image of himself with medics at University College Hospital in London captured a board listing patients on the ward in the background.   Mr Hunt made the blunder as he went online to defend his plans to impose new seven-day working contracts after NHS staff flooded Twitter with selfies of themselves in hospitals with the hashtag ImInWorkJeremy.  He wrote a message on Twitter calling for a 'modern contract' for doctors and swiftly afterwards posted a picture of himself with medics at UCLH hospital - although it later emerged the photo was taken on a visit yesterday, not during a weekend shift.",
