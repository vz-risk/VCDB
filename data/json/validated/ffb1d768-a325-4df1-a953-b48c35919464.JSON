  "summary": "Toledo Police Department is revisiting its safety procedures after authorized documentation was found in the trash.  A local blogger posted a video of documents he found in trash bins outside of Toledo Police Department\u2019s SWAT headquarters.  Blogger Aaron Collins showed 13abc the sensitive suspect information he found in the trash outside TPD\u2019s Swat Building.  \u201cAll this information is here; if I wanted to, I could have peoples\u2019 identities,\u201d Collins said. He added that the information could put a person\u2019s life in danger. \u201cIf I were inclined to, I could say, \u2018hey the police are looking for you\u2019, or \u2018hey, here\u2019s where this guy is. Go get your man\u2019\u201d.\u201d  Collins told 13abc he found the documents last week: paperwork with social security numbers, birthdays, alias, and addresses. He said there were even documents with information about TPD officers.  \u201cThis one is a police officer\u2019s home address,\u201d Collins said.",
