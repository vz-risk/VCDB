  "summary": "The West Coast District Health Board has apologised after it posted two pages of a woman's private medical records to the wrong person.  The papers were mistakenly sent to Ashburton woman Jen Branje, who was living in Westport when she had surgery at Grey Base Hospital last year.  She lodged an ACC claim, and asked the hospital to post her records to back up her complaint.  They arrived in the mail, but were accompanied by two additional pages belonging to a different Westport woman with a completely different name and NHI patient number.",
