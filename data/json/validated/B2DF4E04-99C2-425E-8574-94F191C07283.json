  "summary": "A Belgian telecom company that handles some of the undersea cables that carry international voice traffic said Monday that its internal network had been compromised sometime in the last few months and malware had planted on some of its systems. Belgacom said the attack only affected its own systems, and not those of customers, and said it has filed a complaint with the Belgian federal authorities about the incident.  The attack reportedly affected a few dozen machines on Belgacoms network, including some servers, and the companys CEO said in a press conference that he had no idea how long the malware had been present in the network. There are reports that the intrusion had been active for as long as two years by the time the Belgian company discovered it. Later releases tied the incident to the British government.",
