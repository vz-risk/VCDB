  "summary": "CAVHS Alternate Privacy Officer was notified today that a Veteran seen in the Emergency Department was given another patients medication. The medication was dropped from the Pharmacy by secure carrier as appropriate. The medication bottle was bagged in a brown bag with a printed label including the patients full name, date of birth and address. The patient that the medication actually belonged to was in the waiting area and after some time he came and questioned if his medication was ready. The nurse then realized the wrong patient had signed for, and was given the other patients medication. Attempts have been made to contact the patient that received the medication to recover it but we have not been able to speak to him yet.",
