  "summary": "On October 31, 2015, an individual entered a restricted area of St. Luke's Cornwall Hospital (\"SLCH\") and stole a USB thumb drive that may have contained  limited protected health information for some patients.  SLCH takes the privacy and security of its patients' information very seriously and is cooperating with law enforcement personnel in their investigation.  As soon as the theft was discovered, SLCH began an investigation to determine what information was on the thumb drive. SLCH's investigation revealed that  the stolen thumb drive appears to have included a file which may have contained for some patients their name, medical record number, date of service, type of imaging service received, and administrativetype information used for internal business purposes.  The thumb drive did not contain any Social Security numbers or electronic medical records, which remain secure.  Out of an abundance of caution, SLCH is offering identity theft recovery services through ID Experts, the data breach and recovery services expert, at no cost to the individual. ID Experts fully managed recovery services will provide 12 months of complete access to their fraud resolution representatives. With this protection, ID Experts will help resolve issues if the individual's identity is compromised.",
