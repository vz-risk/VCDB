  "summary": "A registered nurse (RN) called in on Wednesday 07/06/11 requesting emergency annual leave. She had received a phone call from a family member and learned\nthat her uncle was missing. She called another RN several times that day asking if her uncle had been admitted to the hospital. The other RN told her that they did not recognize the name and was unable to confirm or deny. She told the same RN on Thursday that she had looked in the uncles CPRS chart to determine the\nlast time he was seen by a doctor and the status of his current medical condition.",
