  "summary": "For nearly six months, an array of machines at a computer lab was infected with keystroke logging software. The program recorded every single key entered into the computer between September 2013 and March 2014. My understanding was that the individual charged was a student at the college, said NRP media officer Derek Watson. The malicious software was installed across 10 computers at the campus, but neither the NRP or the college has a clear understanding of how many users logged into the machines and had their information stolen during the six-month period of infection.",
