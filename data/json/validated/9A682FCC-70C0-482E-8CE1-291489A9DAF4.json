  "summary": "During a routine inventory of VA imaging equipment, it was discovered that four devices capable of storing VA data could not be located. Three are Personal Computers and one is a Western Digital USB Drive. No determination has been made if the devices were encrypted or the kind of data the devices supported. The inventory list states the devices may have been transferred to another VA without proper documentation. A Report of Survey has been submitted to Logistics and the VA Police have been notified.  This is informational for IT Equipment Inventory incidents and is the representative ticket. There were a total of 7 IT Equipment Inventory Incidents this reporting period. Because of repetition, the other 6 are not included in this report, but are included in the \"IT Equipment Inventory Incidents\" count at the end of this report.",
