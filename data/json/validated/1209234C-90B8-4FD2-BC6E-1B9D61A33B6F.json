  "summary": " Police are investigating an apparent credit and debit card scam involving tiny video cameras hidden on Long Island Rail Road ticket vending machines.  The Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police Department first learned of the scam after a customer found one of the small video cameras on the floor -- having apparently fallen off a ticket vending machine.  Authorities went on to find hidden cameras attached to seven machines at four LIRR stations: Bayside and Great Neck on the Port Washington branch, Merillon Avenue on the Huntington/Port Jefferson branch, and Greenvale on the Oyster Bay branch. MTA Police Chief Michael Coan said the cameras, mounted on a small, black metal strip attached with an adhesive, were made to look like they were part of the ticket vending machines.",
