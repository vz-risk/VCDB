  "summary": "Police in Edinburgh have warned people who used two cash machines on Saturday to check their accounts for unusual transactions.  Card skimming devices were found on machines at RS McColl in Frederick Street and Thomas Cook in Hanover Street in the city centre.  Anyone who used these machines should contact their bank and check their account immediately.  PC Steven Skirving, who is leading the investigations, said: These illegal devices are attached to cash machines and are used to copy a users bank card details, allowing a thief to come along later and use that information to steal from their account.  They are typically used for short periods of time, and it is good that we have been able to recover these devices and prevent further theft, however it is possible that innocent members of the public are at risk from having their accounts plundered.  \"Therefore I would urge anyone who used either of these cash machines to check their bank account, either at a branch or by telephone or online.  If anyone saw someone hanging about these machines, or apparently acting suspiciously, I would urge them to contact us so we can get their description.",
