  "summary": "A recent break-in at a UPMC physician office underscored the need to store computer files properly. Several personal computers were taken. One of them contained information on approximately 700 patients.  UPMC immediately reported the break-in to the local authorities and performed an internal investigation. All patients whose information was stolen were notified of the theft, and UPMC offered to reimburse those patients for the cost of credit monitoring services for one year.  All staff and physicians are reminded to store computer files properly. Do not store confidential patient information on a local drive on your computer (your hard drive, usually called C:). Instead, store information on your network shared drive or departmental shared folder.  Adhering to this UPMC policy by storing all business and patient files on the network servers reduces the ability of a computer thief to obtain confidential patient information.  UPMC staff and physicians are required, as a condition of employment, to take appropriate measures to protect against theft or inappropriate disclosure of confidential patient information. Staff who fail to protect patient information or inappropriately disclose patient information face disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.",
