  "summary": "In a scam never seen before in Ontario, a Toronto-area law firm lost \u201ca large six figure\u201d over the holidays after a virus gave hackers backdoor access to its bookkeeper\u2019s computer. The virus copied bank account passwords as she typed them.  The virus \u201ctricked the [bookkeeper] into giving the trust account\u2019s password to the fraudsters, allowing them essentially full access to the trust account, including the ability to go in, monitor it, and wire money to foreign countries shortly after deposits were made,\u201d Pinnington adds.  Pinnington believes the hacking took place after the bookkeeper clicked on a link, opened an e-mail attachment or downloaded something as mundane as a screen saver from the Internet.  The built-in program, in this case, was the Trojan banker virus. It has an ability to mimic a bank\u2019s web site and when a user types in a password, the program logs the keys and sends a transcript to the hackers in real time. An e-mail pretending to be from the bank may have provided the bookkeeper a link that launched into a spoof web site prompting her to log in, says Pinnington. But she couldn\u2019t successfully gain access using her primary password. Another window, also designed to look like the bank\u2019s web site, then asked her for her name and telephone number.",
