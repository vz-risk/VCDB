  "summary": "An employee received a call from Port City Glass stating that they received a patient's records on their fax. They were told to shred the information that they received and told that the Privacy Officer would probably call them immediately. The patient's information was faxed to the wrong place by one of our employees. This information was ripped up by the employee at Port City Glass. The Privacy Officer asked the employee to put the ripped information in an envelope and send it directly back to the Privacy Officer to destroy. The employee did not have the appropriate shredder. The information that the Port City Glass was able to give us was the patient name, full SSN, and DOB.",
