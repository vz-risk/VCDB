  "summary": "Two women pleaded guilty Tuesday to their roles in a theft from an 88-year-old Alzheimer's patient. Prosecutors say Josie Nance, 20, of Chesapeake, Ohio was a Certified Nursing Assistant at Madison Park Senior Community in Huntington when she stole a patient's credit card and a necklace.  During a hearing Tuesday in Cabell County Circuit Court, Nance pleaded guilty to two counts of fraudulent abuse of an access device and one count fraudulent schemes.  Prosecutors say Nance charged $106 on the credit card.  Amber Shoop, 25, of Chesapeake, Ohio also entered a guilty plea to fraudulent abuse of an access device. She also pleaded guilty to transferring stolen property.  Prosecutors say Shoop sold the $400 necklace that Nance stole for $45.  As part of the plea, Nance will have to pay restitution to the victim's family. The victim has since passed away. ",
