  "summary": "Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles has reported the scope of their previously reported data breach is much larger than they initially realized, according to an Los Angeles Times report.  In August, the hospital reported at least 500 patients' protected health information was compromised after an unencrypted laptop was stolen from an employee's home in June.  Now, the hospital says the laptop contained medical records of more than 33,000 patients, according to the report. They revised the number of affected patients after consulting with a data forensics firm.  The breached data includes patient names, medical data, health insurance information, birth dates, driver's license numbers and approximately 1,500 patients' Social Security numbers, according to the report.  The hospital is currently \"in the process of confirming\" that employee laptops are properly encrypted, according to the report.",
