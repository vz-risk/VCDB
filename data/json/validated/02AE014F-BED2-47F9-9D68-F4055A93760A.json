  "summary": "India is dealing with one of the worst data breaches ever to hit the country with as many as 3.2 million debit card details stolen from multiple banks and financial platforms.  On Thursday, the Economic Times reported that malware was used to compromise the Hitachi Payment Services platform, used to power India's ATM, point-of-sale (PoS) systems and other financial transactions.  This infection then affected the State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI, Yes, Axis and HDFC, which are said to be the hardest hit. The Visa and Mastercard networks are also allegedly affected by the data breach -- which took roughly six weeks to detect.  Little is known beyond feedback from several victims who claim that their cards are being used fraudulently in China.",
