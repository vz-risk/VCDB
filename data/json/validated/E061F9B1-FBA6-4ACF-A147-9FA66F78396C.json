A law firm investigating the breach says data leaked on the dark web affected customers of eye care providers SpecSavers and Costco as well as U.S. firms HoustonEye, Kaiser, Mayo Clinic and Optos.\n\nA customer in Kelowna received the official breach notification related to SpecSavers this week.\n\nThe customer tells Castanet exposed data may include:\n\nFull name\nContact information\nDate of birth\nGender\nPersonal health number\nPrescription details\nHealth insurance information\nThe company says that no payment or credit card information was accessed.\n\nAs a precaution, Ocuco is offering 24 months of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services through TransUnion Canada to all affected individuals.\"",
