  "summary": "A female patient reported being inappropriately contacted via her cellular phone and received text messaging multiple times by a male VA employee. The patient allegedly reports that the VA employee accessed her medical record to obtain her personal phone number. The VA employee's supervisor and Administrative Officer of that facility met with the patient to discuss the issue and the patient was offered the opportunity to file a formal complaint. There is currently an ongoing VA Police investigation of the allegation against this employee. The Information Security Officer (ISO) is conducting a sensitive access report (SAR) audit.  Incident Update\n01/19/12:\nThe VISN ISO was not able to perform a SAR as this medical record was not marked \"sensitive\" at the time the incident occurred. Since then, the medical record has been marked \"sensitive\" for future tracking. The VA employee has been placed on Authorized Absence until the investigation is completed by Human Resources (HR) and VA Police.\n02/02/12:\nPer the Chief of Police, the employee admitted to accessing the patient's record while he was not performing his official duties and obtaining her phone number. Therefore the patient will receive a letter offering credit protection services.\nResolution",
