The hospital system publicly acknowledged the incident in a news release in October, saying that it was notified by Experian Health in August that Experian mistakenly sent patient information to other health care facilities during a computer system upgrade in March.  That information included names, account numbers, medical record numbers and birthdays. Addresses, Social Security numbers and clinical information were not exposed in the incident, according to the hospital system.",
