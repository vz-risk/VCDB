  "summary": "Clerk fired; six-year-old Nevaeh Denine among Eastern Health patients whose information was accessed With her daughter undergoing chemotherapy treatments for cancer, it's understandable that Holly Denine's heart jumps up in her throat every time her phone rings and a 777 number appears.  Thursday morning, it happened  but it wasn't bad news about the health of six-year-old Nevaeh. Eastern Health managers were calling to let Holly know Nevaeh's medical information was involved in a privacy breach.  Eastern Health confirmed in a media release Thursday afternoon that a clerk based in St. John's has been fired for inappropriately accessing the health information of 25 patients. The person accessed the files over a period of several months, and was discovered in late February during a random audit conducted within the person's department.  Eastern Health has identified the patients whose information was accessed, and is in the process of contacting them.",
