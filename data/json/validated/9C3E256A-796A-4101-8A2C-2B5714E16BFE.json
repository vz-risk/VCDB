  "summary": "A facility Privacy Officer (PO) walked past a vehicle parked on the VA campus and noticed a stack of medical records in the front passenger seat of a car. The VA Police assisted in identifying the owner of the vehicle who is a contract VA Provider. The provider met the PO at the vehicle and the records were determined to be from his private practice. The only VA information was today_s VA Surgery schedule which the provider explained he had unintentionally left in the vehicle when he had gone to the car during the day. It is anticipated that the schedule was left unattended for approximately 45 minutes to an hour. It was folded and only 5 Veterans' names, full SSNs, full dates of birth, and the type of surgery scheduled were viewable. There were 20 others that were not viewable through the window and it is not believed the vehicle had been accessed while the provider was away because it was locked. The PO has the document in his investigation file.",
