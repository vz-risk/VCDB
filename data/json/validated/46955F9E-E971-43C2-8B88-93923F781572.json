  "summary": "VAIL, Colo. (CBS4)__ Police in Vail have issued a warning to consumers after a credit card skimmer was found on an ATM inside the Vail Transportation Center.  The skimmer was found in the transportation center located at 241 S. Frontage Road in Vail. The device was attached directly over the card reader for the machine and was nearly impossible to detect by users.  Skimming devices read the information stored on the card while the card passes through the attached device. The vendor of the ATM, Alpine Vending, discovered the device after receiving a complaint from a customer who believed activity on a credit card account was related to the use of the machine.  Police believe the device may have been in place for weeks and was enabled with a Bluetooth which allow the criminals to access the stolen data without physically touching the skimmer. They can download the information within Bluetooth range, about 30 to 300 feet.  Police say it's good practice to try to conceal your PIN while entering it on the keyboard and that one of the most effective ways to guard against fraud is the close monitoring of your account.  ",
