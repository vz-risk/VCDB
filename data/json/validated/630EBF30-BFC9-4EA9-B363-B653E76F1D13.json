  "summary": "St. Louis County officials are investigating a violation of federal health privacy law involving a health department employee who allegedly mishandled email information of inmates at the county jail.  The county said the employee emailed a document to her account containing names and Social Security numbers of some inmates from 2008 through last year.  The action violates the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.  The county did not identify the employee, who resigned in November after working for the county for 25 years. The employee had a clerical position in which she verified medical claims information for inmates.  The HIPAA breach was discovered after she left the job, county officials said.  In a statement, the county said, It does not appear that anyone other than that former county employee has had any access to the information contained in the document.  County officials would not discuss a possible motive for the employees action.",
