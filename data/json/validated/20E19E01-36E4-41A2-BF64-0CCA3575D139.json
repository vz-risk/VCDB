AIB in Adare and Raheen as well as PTSB banks in St Nessans Road Dooradoyle and William Street are understood to be locations where the card PIN numbers were obtained.  At least five transactions have been traced to the accounts of Limerick bank customers where upwards of 1,000 worth of debits are pending authorisation from as far as Chicago, New York and Sydney.  Further reports have emerged regarding other suspicious transactions appearing on customer accounts from as far as Thailand and Eastern Europe, but these have not been confirmed and are being investigated by the banks.
