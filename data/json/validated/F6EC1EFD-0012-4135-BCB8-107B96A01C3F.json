  "summary": "\"Cox Enterprises, a major U.S. conglomerate operating in telecommunications and automotive services, experienced a data breach after cybercriminals exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the Oracle E-Business Suite (Oracle EBS). The breach occurred between August 9 and August 14, 2025, but was not detected until late September. The Cl0p ransomware group claimed responsibility for the attack, which leveraged CVE-2025-61882, a critical vulnerability that allowed remote, unauthenticated access to sensitive data. Following the breach, Cox Enterprises notified 9,479 impacted individuals and offered complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection. The incident highlights the significant risks posed by vulnerabilities in widely used enterprise resource planning (ERP) platforms and demonstrates the broad impact such attacks can have across multiple sectors.\"",
