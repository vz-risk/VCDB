  "summary": " The ABC7 I-Team has learned some people who applied for Illinois concealed carry gun permits are being notified of a computer glitch that may have allowed other applicants to see their personal information.  State police tell the I-Team the problem happened on the first day that people were able to apply using the Illinois concealed carry website. The problem was discovered January 5 and the letters sent out by state police are dated March 4.  \"Essentially they have everything they need to create, create a new me. How am I going to make sure that there aren't people out there, people aren't getting guns in my name I have no control over?\" said Eric Larkey, concealed carry participant.   A state police spokesperson says the problem lasted only during a short period of time and there's no evidence any personal information was stolen.  Eyewitness News initially reported incorrectly that 50,000 letters were sent out, but we're now told a few hundred were mailed as a precaution. ",
