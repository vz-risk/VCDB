  "summary": "Hospital officials said the PCs were stolen from an employees car in March. The employee was transporting the PCs to a location where they could be destroyed.  Hospital officials believe the information on the hard drives would not be useful to identity thieves.  However, the hospital is notifying patients affected by the theft.  The hospital takes a data snapshot of every PC before junking it. It was able to look back and see what was on the hard drives.  And we saw that there was a small handful of archive of documents that had been archived on the PCs local drive containing fairly limited information relating to 1,213 patients, said John Friberg, senior vice president of Elliot Hospital.  The computers had auto-archived three spreadsheets and 20 emails. The documents included very basic information about patients, such as their names, dates of service and various billing codes.  its very important to keep in mind or to understand that this is not a situation involving the breach of electronic medical records, Friberg said. In fact, none of the information involved any medical records. For instance, nothing on these four PCs related to any medical history of any patients.  The hospital has since made changes to ensure its computers no longer auto-archive this information. Officials believe the information is unlikely to be of any value to possible identity thieves. However, they understand patients will be upset.  We do realize at Elliot that these sorts of issues can be very concerning and confusing for people, and we certainly do empathize with that concern, Friberg said.  Elliot Hospital is sending out letters to the patients affected and setting up a toll-free number to help answer questions.",
