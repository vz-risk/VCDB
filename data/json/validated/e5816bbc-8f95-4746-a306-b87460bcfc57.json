Widup was deputy chief investigator in the DA\u2019s office during the period of the alleged crimes: June 1, 2016, until July 5, 2017.The Pueblo Chieftain obtained a copy of the 11-page indictment Wednesday. It had been under seal since January, when a grand jury issued it.Previous reports in The Chieftain were based on other court documents that were not sealed.The indictment also accuses Widup of being part of a ring that collected and transported funds from this \u201cgambling and illegal debt collection operation.\u201cHe is scheduled to go on trial Oct. 29 in Denver District (state) Court. He has pleaded not guilty.The Colorado Attorney General\u2019s office, based in Denver, obtained the indictment after an investigation of Widup and others, who allegedly conspired to operate the bookmaking and debt collection ring.Widup \u201cused subterfuge with other members of his office to access information\u201d to facilitate \u201cthe collection of these (gambling) proceeds and illegal debts,\u201d the indictment alleges.
