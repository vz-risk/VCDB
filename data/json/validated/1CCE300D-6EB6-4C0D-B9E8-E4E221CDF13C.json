  "summary": "State Attorney General Greg Abbott's office inadvertently gave the Social Security numbers of millions of Texas voters to opposing lawyers in the voter ID case but said on Wednesday the information never was exposed publicly. The slip occurred when Texas was ordered to give lawyers challenging the voter ID law a voter database for analysis. Abbott's office mistakenly believed the database maintained by the Secretary of State's office included only the last four digits of voters' Social Security numbers, said First Assistant Attorney General Daniel Hodge. The attorney general's office gave the records to the opposing lawyers on password-protected, encrypted disks, Hodge said. The state then found out from an opposing lawyer that a number of the names in the database included full Social Security numbers. The mistake was discovered by an analyst who opened the disk and saw the information, Hodge said. Abbott spokeswoman Lauren Bean said the disk included records for 13 million Texas voters. She said about half contained full Social Security numbers. Hodge emphasized that the six copies of the disk were under a protective order from the court to ensure they would be kept confidential. When Abbott's office learned April 12 that the full Social Security numbers were included for some voters, it dispatched a state police officer to New York, Washington D.C., and Boston to retrieve the disks. The state also obtained declarations - made under penalty of perjury - by two analysts who opened the disks that they made no copies and didn't share the information, Bean said. No one else viewed the information, Hodge said. The state provided new disks to lawyers challenging the law. \"At no time were these Social Security numbers exposed to the public,\" Hodge said. \"No one was ever at risk.\" Democrats immediately seized on the incident. \"It's shocking that a person who claims to be so concerned by identify theft could be this reckless with Texans' most private information. Greg Abbott clearly has misplaced priorities,\" said Texas Democratic Party spokeswoman Rebecca Acua.",
