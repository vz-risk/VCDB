  "summary": "Sensitive details of health workers employed by the US military's Special Operations Command (Socom) have been exposed in a data breach. The 11GB of data included social security numbers, names, addresses and salaries of some Socom staff. All the workers, including some with top secret clearances, were employed by subcontractor Potomac Healthcare. The company has now removed the data and said it was investigating the breach.  The cache of data was found unprotected on the net by researcher Chris Vickery, from security company MacKeeper.",
