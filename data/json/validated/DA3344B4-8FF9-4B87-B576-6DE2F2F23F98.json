  "summary": "NASHVILLE, TN (WSMV) -  Thousands of Comcast customers are believed to be the victims of identity theft.  A Midstate woman who worked for the cable company faces charges for leaking customers' personal information.  Valerie Nichols, of Pleasant View, has been arrested as part of a multi-state conspiracy involving stealing Comcast customers' personal information and selling it to co-conspirators who set up fraudulent accounts in Louisiana.  Nichols worked at the Comcast call center near Opryland.  According to the sheriff's department in Caddo Parish, LA, Nichols stole customer information and sold it to a contractor that was paid to open new accounts for Comcast in the Shreveport area.  That information was used to set up more than 3,000 fake accounts.  The Caddo Parish Sheriff's Department said 10 people have been arrested so far. Officials said this is a multi-million dollar conspiracy.  The problem was first discovered when customers came forward saying they were getting collection notices for accounts they didn't know existed.  Nichols is currently in jail in Louisiana.  Comcast issued a statement commending the sheriff's department for aggressively pursuing the case.  Comcast said it has contacted the people affected and will provide them with credit monitoring services. ",
