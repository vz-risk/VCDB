  "summary": "Marin Medical Practices Concepts electronic medical record system hacked, ransom paid  The computer records of Marin Medical Practice Concepts, a Novato company that provides medical billing and electronic medical records services to many Marin physicians, were hacked on July 26. As a result, some Marin doctors were unable to access their patients' medical records for more than a week.  information includes vital signs, limited clinical history, documentation of physical examinations, and any record of the communication between patients and their physician during a visit in that 15 day period.  Although no financial or personal patient information was found to be compromised, one of the company's backup systems failed during the data-restoration process; the data loss occurred at the time of the system restore due to a faulty backup system  not due to the malware",
