Divorce granted 8/15/12 \naccording to The Oklahoma State Courts Network website. He states that she used the information in their divorce. Ex-wife is an employee at the VA and is in \nnursing. She is the nursing patient flow coordinator. At this point of entering the ticket, the Privacy Officer (PO) believes employee did not have a need to know or \nthe need to enter Veteran's CPRS record. SPAR shows that the ex-wife accessed CPRS record on 07/30/12, 07/31/12 before the divorce was granted, the Veteran \ndid not have any visits on those days.
