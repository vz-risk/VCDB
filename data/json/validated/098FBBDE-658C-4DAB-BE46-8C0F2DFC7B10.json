The inland North County health care system is reaching out to patients affected by the late February theft of the items, spokeswoman Bobette Brown said. Palomar Health runs Palomar Medical Center in Escondido and Pomerado Hospital in Poway.  The laptop was encrypted, but the two flash drives were not, Brown said. ",
