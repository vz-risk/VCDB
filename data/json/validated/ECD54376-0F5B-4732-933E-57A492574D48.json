  "summary": "A VA provider requesting a Veteran_s record from a non-VA hospital transposed 2 digits of the hospital_s fax number when the release form was faxed out on 05/25/12. The fax was received at a residence. The recipient saw the name of the intended hospital and carried it to their facility to complain on 05/30/12. He told the hospital not to allow anyone to use his fax number unless the documents are for him. The fax was handed off to the provider who was expecting the request and he contacted the Portland VA Medical Center_s Privacy Officer (PO) to notify the facility of the error. The name of the private recipient is not known. The release contained the Veteran's name, date of birth and last four digits of the SSN.",
