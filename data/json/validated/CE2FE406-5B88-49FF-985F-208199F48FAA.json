  "summary": "On September 15, 2014, a Veterans Health Administration New Federal Rule of Hydrocodone Combination Products information letter was mailed to approximately 4,000 Veterans. On September 17, 2014, the Privacy Office was notified the letters mailed were printed double-sided, which means only 2,000 letters were mailed, with another Veterans name/information printed on the other side. VA cannot determine which Veterans information was disclosed out of the 4,000 letters mailed. The letters were folded and stuffed in the envelopes, so there is no way to determine who received the letters and who did not. The information breached is full name, address, and that the patient is currently prescribe a Hydrocodone product.",
