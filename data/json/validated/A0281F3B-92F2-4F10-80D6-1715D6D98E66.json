  "summary": "Health care company Humana is warning Atlanta residents about a possible security breach that could affect nearly 3,000 members in the area.  According to the company, an Atlanta-area Humana associate's vehicle was broken into and an unencrypted USB drive was stolen with the associate's encrypted laptop computer.  The USB drive contained names, some medical records information and some Social Security numbers for 2,962 Humana members in the Atlanta area, the company said.  Humana said that it \"has no reason to believe that the information has been used inappropriately.\" The company has begun notifying the members who were potentially affected. The company will provide free access to a credit-monitoring service for those members.  Members enrolled in Medicare plans who have any questions about this may contact Humana at 1-800-457-4708, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Members enrolled in non-Medicare plans should call 1-800-448-6262.  Any Humana member who believes their information is being used by another party is urged to contact Humana at once.",
