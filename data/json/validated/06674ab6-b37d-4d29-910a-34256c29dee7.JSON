Routine scans on the network flagged suspect activity on an administrator account. Latitude revealed that the attackers gained employee login credentials through an attack on a third party (understood to be DXC technology), and used them to steal personal information from two other service providers. Latitude Financial refused to pay a ransom request not to sell the information on the Dark Web. The incident cost the company $53MM according to its financial statements. Latitude also confirmed that 6.1 million customer records that were provided before 2013 were compromised in the hack, including some dating back to 2005. ",
