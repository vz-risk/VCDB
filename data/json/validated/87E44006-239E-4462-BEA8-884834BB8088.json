  "summary": "Notifications sent out to employees and contractors of the U.S. Department of Energy have confirmed that it and its networks have been the latest victim of \"sophishicated hackers\" in search of confidential information.  The breach was confirmed for the Washington Free Beacon by unnamed officials from inside the department, and it apparently happened two weeks ago.  The attackers - thought to be working at the behest of a nation state - have managed to penetrate a 14 computer servers and 20 workstations located at the Department's headquarters, and have succeeded in exfiltrating personally identifiable information on several hundred employees and contractors.  According to reports, there are indications that the attackers might have also had other goals in mind - namely to either steal confidential information or to pave the way for future intrusions that would make that possible.
