  "summary": "\tAt least 8.2 million user credentials have been compromised from gaming website Gamigo and then dumped online, a hacker news site reportede Tuesday.   The Hacker News said the compromised usernames, emails and encrypted passwords included three million from the US, 2.4 million from Germany and 1.3 million from France.   \"Its the largest leak Ive ever actually seen. When this breach originally happened, the data wasnt released, so it wasnt a big concern. Now eight million email addresses and passwords have been online, live data for any hacker to see,\" it quoted PwnedList founder Steve Thomas as saying.   Gamigo's hack was the latest in a series of attacks against other sites including LinkedIn, eHarmony, Last.fm, Yahoo, Android Forums, Formspring, and Nvidia.   As early as March 1, Gamigo sent out an e-mail to its users informing them that game servers, websites and forums are partially unreachable at the moment due to an attack on the Gamigo database.   \"Your character data, including items, is safely stored on the backup! We cannot rule out that the intruder(s) is/are still in possession of additional personal data, although to date we have received no report of any fraudulent use,\" The Hacker News quoted Gamigo as saying in the email.   It added that to prevent unauthorized access to users' accounts, Gamigo reset all passwords for the Gamigo account system and for all Gamigo games.",
