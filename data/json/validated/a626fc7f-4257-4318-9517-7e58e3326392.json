  "summary": "An Edmonton woman who filed a complaint about the size of a Good Friday service says she feels her privacy was violated when an Alberta Health Services inspector disclosed her identity to that church.  In an email obtained by Postmedia, the inspector warned a church in the Alberta Avenue neighbourhood it would be shut down if inspectors found more than 15 people on the premises Easter Sunday, in light of COVID-19 restrictions on gatherings. The woman who made the complaint, whom Postmedia is not naming for privacy reasons, was copied on the same email sent to the church, which included her name and email address. The inspector attempted to recall the email multiple times.",
