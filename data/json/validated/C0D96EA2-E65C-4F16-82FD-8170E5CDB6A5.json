  "summary": "A laptop containing the details of a number of children attending HSE Speech and Language Therapy services in Donegal has been stolen. It has emerged the laptop was taken from the boot of a staff member's car. Garda_ have launched an investigation. It is being reported that the parents and guardians of the children attending the services in Donegal received letters, dated November 7, from the HSE this week informing them of the theft. The laptop included a caseload register which had the names, age group, schools, addresses and phone numbers of a number of children. The Data Protection Commissioner has instructed the service manager in the county to inform the parents of it. The theft apparently happened around 100 miles from the county and there is little likelihood, says the letter, of local access to the information. The HSE is apologising for the breach and says steps are being taken to prevent any similar occurrence.  The HSE has confirmed that there were approximately 180 childrens details on the Speech abnd Language Therapy Service laptop stolen from the boot of a car last week.  The register has the details of the children listed by service location, care group, their name, address and contact phone number.  Responding to queries from Highland Radio News, the HSE has confirmed the laptop was fully encrypted.  The HSE says it has written to all parents of clients whose details were on the register to inform them of the breach, and advising them whom then should contact if they had any concerns.  The matter was immediately reported to an Garda Siochana who are investigating the theft. It has also been notified to the Data Protection Commissioner.  The statement concludes that this incident has had no impact on service provision.",
