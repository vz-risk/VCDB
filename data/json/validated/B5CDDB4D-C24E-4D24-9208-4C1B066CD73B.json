An additional signer was selected from the \"Identify Additional Signers\" dropdown box that was the wrong recipient (the same person for both veteran notes). The person chosen as the recipient is non-clinical with no authorized access to CPRS. This clinical employee clicked \"OK\" in the dropdown box. This generated a Vista Mailman View Alert message to the recipient as an additional signer.\nThis person opened the Vista Mailman message, and was able to open the veteran's electronic progress note in VISTA (TIU format).\nProblem---- Medical record access given to unauthorized recipient",
