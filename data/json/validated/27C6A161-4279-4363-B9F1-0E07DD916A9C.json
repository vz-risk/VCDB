  "summary": "NeoGAF, a popular video game forum that has over 114,000 members, has been hacked. The sites administrators have initialized a password reset procedure for all users since the attackers might have stolen some information.  We've just had an admin account compromised briefly by an automated attack. The hole was immediately plugged, but we're forcing a site-wide password reset for the safety of the members since it's possible they obtained some data, Tyler Malka, the owner of NeoGAF, stated.",
