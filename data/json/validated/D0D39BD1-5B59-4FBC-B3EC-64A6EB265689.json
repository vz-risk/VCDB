  "summary": "Last week, a medical waste company in Nebraska had an improperly secured truck door, which led to hundreds of medical records to be blown onto the street. According to KETV in Omaha, a Medi-Waste Disposal truck was driving in Omaha and the door on the truck was not closed properly. Possibly thousands of pieces of paper were tossed from the truck.2014-10-15-Mobile-EHR-v-pap  It was not certain where the records originated from, according to the news station, just that they left an Omaha facility to be stored in Lincoln.  I saw the truck driving by, a bunch of papers flying out of it, said local business owner Jason Bucsis. Thee back was down, I saw a couple of boxes fall out. The whole thing was wide open to the top you could see inside and everything.  The news report said that volunteers attempted to retrieve as many of the papers as possible, and that the records contained patients personal medical information.  Medi-Waste owner Ryan Funk told KETV that the driver did not have the truck properly secured and that this has never happened before. However, Funk added that he believes they recovered nearly all of the documents and said that good Samaritans should be credited with saving as many documents as they did.  Moreover, Medi-Waste said that it promises to establish new checks and balances to secure documents in the future.",
