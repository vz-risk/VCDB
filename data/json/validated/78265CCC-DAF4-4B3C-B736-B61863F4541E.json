  "summary": "Recently, we discovered a new IE zero-day exploit in the wild, which has been used in a strategic Web compromise. Specifically, the attackers inserted this zero-day exploit into a strategically important website, known to draw visitors that are likely interested in national and international security policy. We have identified relationships between the infrastructure used in this attack and that used in Operation DeputyDog. Furthermore, the attackers loaded the payload used in this attack directly into memory without first writing to disk  a technique not typically used by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors. This technique will further complicate network defenders ability to triage compromised systems, using traditional forensics methods.",
