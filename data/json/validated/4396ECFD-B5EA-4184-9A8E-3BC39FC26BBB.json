  "summary": "The Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) has started notifying around 50,000 individuals after the organizations systems have been breached by cybercriminals.   According to MDCH representatives, the reports accessed by the hackers contained names, dates of birth and social security numbers, along with testing results and testing dates. However, MDCH highlights that medical records have not been compromised.  It did not include any address or identifiable contact information because, again, these are not medical records  they were simply testing reports, MDCH spokesperson Angela Minicuci said, cited by CBS Detroit.  The organization has removed all files from the impacted website and moved them to a secure server.  So far, theres no evidence that the compromised data has been misused, but impacted individuals are advised to file a fraud alert with credit bureaus.",
