  "summary": "Covered California is under fire for giving out names of people who looked but didn't buy.  Officials with Covered California, the state's federally mandated health insurance exchange, has released the names of potential insurance customers to insurance agents.  The names were from people who went online, registered, and looked at the policies offered.  They didn't sign up, or give permission for information to be passed along.  Some sharp agents are catching the violation of privacy laws and not pursuing the potential customers, others however have contacted potential clients much to their dismay.  The move was enough for Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom to get involved, issuing a statement recommending a consent box be inserted into the Covered California webpage. ",
