  "summary": "The website of the Jamaica Information Service (JIS) has been hacked, but the management is seeking to assure that critical information has not been compromised.  A visit to the website revealed the following message: \"hacked by Holako\".  However, the perpetrator of the attack was not immediately clear.  On a subsequent visit, another message appeared saying the site was \"down for maintenance\".  The JIS is the Government of Jamaica's main media and information arm.  Contacted last this evening, the JIS CEO, Donna-Marie Rowe, said no sensitive information had been lost.  \"The aggressor's attempts at breaching our system did not result in access to  sensitive data but was constrained to 'surface defacement',\" she said in an email.  \"Our security team is undertaking recovery and reinforcement procedures as we speak and the JIS website will resume normal function in short order.\"  This development comes weeks after the government warned its employees of a virus being sent via an email.
