  "summary": "Hackers have leaked a database they claim contains the personal details of more than 40,000 customers of local jewellery chain Goldheart.  The database was shared on hacking forums and the Dark Web around May 20 and appears to contain the records of those who signed up for an online account with Goldheart from 2015 to 2022.  Checks by The Straits Times found that the database contained names, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses and users\u2019 dates of birth. All of the database\u2019s user entries, which numbered over 40,000, had e-mail addresses and birth dates.  In the posts sharing the database, hackers claimed it contained the details of 42,000 Goldheart customers.  However, ST found that less than 4,000 of the entries contained phone numbers and addresses.  Several hundred entries also appeared to be fake and contained spam messages. Goldheart is a subsidiary of jewellery retailer Aspial, which also owns Lee Hwa Jewellery and pawnbroker Maxi-Cash.",
