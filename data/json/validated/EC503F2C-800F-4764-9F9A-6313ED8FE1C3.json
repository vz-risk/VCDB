  "summary": "The College of the Desert experienced a data security breach on Thursday, June 5, 2014.  The data security breach involved the release of the following types of your personal information:  your name, ssn, dob, gender, home zip code, the titles of positions you held at the college (including start and end date of each position held), your employment anniversary date, employee identification number, health insurance benefit plan selection, health insurance subscriber identification number, amount or cost of health insurance subscriber premium, and active or retired employee status.  The breach occurred in the afternoon on Thursday, June 5, 214.  A College employee, without authorization, sent an electronic email message with an attached spreadsheet containing the above classes of personal information.  This email message was sent to a group of approximately 78 college employees.  A message recall was attempted and was successful with some but not all recipients. It is possible that the email and its attachment was delivered to approximately 50 people.  We cannot determine how many people opened the email or viewed the attachment.  The email was deleted from their mail boxes within 24 hours.  ",
