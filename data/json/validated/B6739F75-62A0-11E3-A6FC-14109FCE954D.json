It wasn't caught by the Center or the file room that there were 2 patients' first pages of their reports. Then Patient A came in to request a copy of his report. Once he got home, he realized that he had someone else's information and not all of his report. Patient B's information that was exposed included his name, date of birth, full SSN, history and information on the study, and date of the exam.  Veteran B will be sent a letter offering credit protection services.",
