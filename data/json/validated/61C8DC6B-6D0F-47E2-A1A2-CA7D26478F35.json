Rather than trying to navigate robust software defenses, the phone scam targets human vulnerabilities.\n\nIn this instance, the attackers posed as IT support staff to trick administrators into installing a malicious version of Salesforce Data Loader, disguised under names such as \u201cMy Ticket Portal.\u201d\n\"",
