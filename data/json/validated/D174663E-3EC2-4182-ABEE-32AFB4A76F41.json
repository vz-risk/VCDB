  "summary": "A Hardeeville woman suspected of stealing and using credit cards of a patient at the hospice where she worked has turned herself in.  Shamika Smart, 31, turned herself in Monday morning, according to a news release from the Beaufort County Sheriff's Office. She was wanted on one count of exploitation of a vulnerable adult for stealing and using credit cards that belonged to an 88-year-old patient at a Hilton Head Island hospice.  Smart had arranged to turn herself into investigators Thursday, but she failed to show. The Sheriff's Office asked Friday for the public's help to locate her.  The victim reported three credit cards were stolen on Jan. 21. The cards were used for more than $10,000 in purchases.  Video surveillance footage identified Smart and her aunt, 51-year-old Fannette Renee Housey, using the cards at several locations.  Smart was employed as a medical technician at the hospice and had cared for the victim.  Housey was arrested Feb. 15 on one county of financial transaction card fraud. She has been released on bond.  Smart remains in custody on $50,000 bond.",
