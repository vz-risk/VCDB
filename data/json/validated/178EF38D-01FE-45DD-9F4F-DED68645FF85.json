Patient A reported the incident to the medical center and a replacement has been requested for Patient B. Great Lakes Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) investigation concludes that this is the result of a VAMC incorrect address transmission leading to a USPS misdelivery, not a CMOP packaging error. The medical center has been notified.",
