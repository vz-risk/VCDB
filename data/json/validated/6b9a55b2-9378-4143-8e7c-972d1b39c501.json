  "summary": "Argentina's health officials have apparently exposed personal medical data relating to some 115,000 COVID-19 quarantine exemption applicants, in what represents a major health sector data breach.  The novel coronavirus pandemic has resulted in more data being collected by national governments about their citizens and people seeking to enter the country. The collection and analysis of digital data is seen as necessary in order to stem the tide of the rate of infections, and to orientate health services in preparation for the expected second wave. One downside of amassing large volumes of data is the ability of those possessing the data to leak it, either inadvertently as the result of poor security protocols or as the result of an orchestrated attack.
