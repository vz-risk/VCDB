  "summary": "The NYPD's 122nd Precinct is warning Staten Islanders to keep an eye out for ATM machine scams after a \"skimming\" device was found at a Santander bank branch.  The police department announced the device's discovery on the 122nd Precinct's official Twitter feed Tuesday.  Police couldn't provide any further details as to when or where the device was found. Santander, which used to be called Sovereign Bank, has 20 Staten Island locations.  \"Skimming\" has been around for several years.  The scammers attach devices to the card slot of an ATM so they can steal private data from the magnetic strips on the backs of ATM cards. Typically, they'll plant a hidden camera nearby to spy on victims as they punch in their pin numbers. The hijacked information can then be transferred to blank cards and used to withdraw cash.",
