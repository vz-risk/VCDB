After discovering the unusual activity, CAO immediately launched an investigation, with the assistance of cybersecurity experts, into the nature and scope of the incident. As part of this investigation, CAO determined that multiple employee email accounts were subject to unauthorized access between October 2019 and September 2020, and that certain emails therein were accessible to the responsible cybercriminal as a result. Following this discovery, CAO launched an extensive and thorough data mining effort to identify potentially affected individuals.",
