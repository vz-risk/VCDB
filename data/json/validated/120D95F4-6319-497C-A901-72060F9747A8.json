  "summary": "A mail delivery truck carrying the personal information of 2,400 Kaiser Permanente members on the Inland Empire Health Plan was stolen last month from a parking lot in Santa Clarita, officials announced Friday. Michelle Simms, a Kaiser Permanente spokeswoman, said the health care provider reported the theft to Los Angeles County Sheriff's station in Santa Clarita. Officials believe the incident took place sometime between March 12 and March 14. The vehicle was later recovered, but the mail on the truck was not. It is unclear where or when the truck was found. The mail delivery truck contained \"Evidence of Coverage\" handbooks for Kaiser Permanente California Medi-Cal members in Southern California who are part of the Inland Empire Health Plan. It was not parked in a secure area, which violated Kaiser's vendor mail delivery policies, officials said in a news release. The stolen property contained protected health information, including names, addresses and the handbooks, which provide a generic overview of plan benefits. It did not include Social Security numbers, medical record numbers, descriptions of any medical services, health status or financial and account information, officials said. Kaiser authorities said they have \"no reason to believe the (protected health information) that was stolen could be used for any fraudulent or other improper\" activity. \"We are in the process of notifying and apologizing to our members affected by this incident,\" officials said in a statement. \"We have investigated this matter and are taking appropriate steps to prevent similar errors in the future.\"",
