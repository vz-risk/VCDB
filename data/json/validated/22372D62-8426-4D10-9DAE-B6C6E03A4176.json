  "summary": "A Veteran who was admitted to the facility but requested to be Opted-Out of the facility patient directory had his inpatient status disclosed to his estranged wife by a VA employee. The employee did not check the current Veteran_s electronic medical record to review see his opt-out status before disclosing that he was an inpatient scheduled for surgery. The Veteran was made aware of this error by his clinical support staff and he chose to change his status to include his name in the directory because he felt it was causing too much confusion with people coming to see him.",
