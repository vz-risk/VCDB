  "summary": "On 01/19/12, the VAMC Chief of Police was contacted by the local city Police Department regarding an Offense Report generated by their office on 12/06/11. On that date, a former physician, Physician A, filed a wrongful death complaint against Physician B, who is a current employee of this facility. Physician A provided a verbal report to the city officer, as well as a handwritten statement and two VA documents titled \"Incomplete Records Listing by Physician\". These documents were included with the Offense Report.\nThe report generated from the verbal statement provided by Physician A included the full name, address, and date of birth of Physician B, along with a narrative of the events surrounding deceased Veteran A's hospital course. It is unclear if Physician A provided this information to the city officer or if the information was pulled from a Police database. Veteran A's full name was found in all three documents. The written statement listed Veteran A's medical information, including his diagnoses, medication, and more in depth details of the Veteran's hospital course.\nThe \"Incomplete Records Listing By Physician\" included the full names and last four digits of the SSNs of four Veterans, including Veteran A. It also provided information specific to the type of discharge of the four Veterans, (i.e., transfer out, OPT-NSC, and death). The city Police Officer's Offense Report indicated that Physician A had contacted the VA Office of Inspector General.\nImportant Notes:\n-- Physician A was an employee on the date of the incident; however, he is no longer employed at this facility. -- City Officer Report indicated \"no further investigation pending by this officer.\"\n-- Request has been made to mark Veteran A's CPRS record sensitive.\n-- CPRS records indicated that Veteran A was homeless and that he did not have a valid/legal next-of-kin listed. -- VA Uniformed Officer Report Number was pending at the time of entry of this notification.\n-- VA Police has confirmed that the information was forwarded to the OIG.",
