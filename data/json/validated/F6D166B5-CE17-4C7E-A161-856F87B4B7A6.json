  "summary": "Prudential provides, or in the past did provide, group life insurance to you as a result of your employment relationship with Unisys. I am writing to let you know that a Prudential associate made a clerical error and inadvertently emailed a document containing information relating to your insurance relationship with us, including your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, and salary information, to another individual at Unisys. This occurred on December 13, 2012. The recipient notified the Prudential associate immediately and notified Unisys management, which also notified Prudential. The recipient has deleted the document as well. We have no reason to believe that the information about you has been used improperly or inappropriately or that you are at risk for identity theft because of this matter. Nonetheless, we are sending you this letter because we take our responsibility to safeguard personal information seriously, and we wanted to make you aware of the situation. We have made arrangements to provide you with a two-year complimentary membership in Equifax Credit WatchTM Gold with 3-in-1 Monitoring identity theft protection, a program that monitors your credit file and notifies you of certain activity. The enclosed sheet provides instructions for enrollment and should you choose to enroll, please use the following promotion code XXXXXXXXX, which will be valid for your use through May 31, 2013.",
