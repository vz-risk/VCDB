  "summary": "A physician at the VA Medical Center who is going through an investigation has on three occasions, that we know of, emailed patient information to his outside \ne-mail address and on at least two of these occasions forwarded these emails from his outside email to his attorney. These e-mails included the last name and \nlast 4 of the SSN on two different patients. One of the documents had been stripped of any identifiers. These documents were sent to his attorney without the \npatient consent and without the attorney's request. I have been informed that the board has reported this to VACO.",
