  "summary": "Allegations that a nurse at a major Chicago hospital tweeted about a shooting victim's death and blood-soaked hospital room are a stunning cautionary tale that health care providers can use to hammer home how workers may be held liable for privacy lapses, attorneys say.  The allegations surfaced in a new lawsuit accusing Karrie Anne Runtz, a trauma nurse at Mount Sinai Hospital, of \"recklessly and outrageously\" tweeting about the April 2015 death of 24-year-old Mikal Johnson. According to the suit, Runtz sent tweets to 1,300 followers describing Johnson as \"DOA\" and included a grisly photograph of a large pool of blood in his treatment room.  The now-deleted Twitter account, which was known to local media, used the screename \"Dixie McCall,\" the handle @traumanatrix and the hashtags #sinaitrauma and #westsideshitshow to complain about a steady stream of patients with bullet wounds in Mount Sinai's emergency department. The account's bio section read, \"diva of death..mistress of mayhem. kicking ass, taking names & saving lives. tough as nails chicago chick. you think you know, but you have no idea.\" ",
