  "summary": "On 02/11/10, a total of 22 pages containing PHI of 4 different patients were inadvertently faxed to a wrong fax number. The documents consisted of MRI orders, Registration Form for Veteran/Retired Service Member and authorization sheets. The documents contained full names, full social security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, home telephone numbers, service-connected disability ratings, and diagnosis. The faxes were intended to be sent to Project HERO, Louisville, Kentucky, fax number 877-371-6668. The fax number in New York is 866-867-7146, which is a toll free number. The recipient in New York received the fax information via email, who then forwarded the email to the VA Office of Health Information, who in-turn sent the email to Project HERO, Louisville, Kentucky. According to Project HERO, Manager, Non-VA Care Support Office, the recipient in New York tried to call the VAMC and notify someone about the fax before deleting it. Additionally, the recipient indicated that there was a fax sent from VA Sioux Falls, as well. He deleted that fax also.",
