  "summary": "One of the files in the data  dump is a passwords file with 340 first and last names, usernames, MD5 passwords (some decrypted), and e-mail addresses. A second file, addresses, contains 1,348 entries consisting of agency address, cell phone number, email addresses, first and last names with middle initials, phone numbers, rank, and residential addresses and phone numbers.  And then there are the email spools.  One of the files appears to be from the  New York State Association of Chiefs of Police, but there is no statement on their web site at this time acknowledging or referencing any hack and as of the time of this posting, they have not responded to an email inquiry sent yesterday asking them to confirm or deny whether either or both of the files mentioned above were from their server.  Nor is it clear where/how the email directories of specific police chiefs were obtained. Im not sure why AntiSec thinks that exposing the e-mail of suburban police chiefs who had no involvement in Occupy Wall Street, Attica, or anything other than what seems like routine suburban law enforcement is justified or helpful.  Via Twitter, Ive sought additional details/clarification on this data release, but so far, no information has been forthcoming, making this incident impossible to enter in DataLossDB with any real specificity other than Unknown Organization for the breached entity or entities.  If anyone can provide  additional details that would enable correct attribution of the data, please use the comments section below, email me at breaches@databreaches.net, or DM me @pogowasright  Updated Jan 5: In a new file released today by Anonymous, they indicate that the hack was of nychiefs.org, which is the web site of the  New York State Association of Chiefs of Police.  NYSACOP never responded to the inquiry sent to them by this site asking them to confirm or deny that they experienced a breach.  In their release today, Anonymous summarizes the hack as:  [*] NYCHIEFS.ORG 1. Mail spools for 10 NY Police Chiefs 2. Over 300 usernames and md5-hashed passwords for all NY Chiefs 3. Several Law Enforcement Sensitive and For Official Use Only documents",
