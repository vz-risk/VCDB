  "summary": "Bar applicants need to supply every single piece of personal information imaginable, from their birthday and Social Security number to their 10-year work history. If anyone with criminal intent ever got their hands on that information, we cant even begin to describe how screwed those poor bar applicants would be.  As it turns out, some bar applicants are getting a taste of what it feels like to be violated by a state bar outside of a timed test-taking situation.  Which state bar just exposed an untold number of exam applicants to identity theft due to a break-in?  The State Bar of Nevada recently advised an undisclosed number of applicants that their confidential personal information may have been stolen from its storage facility. Heres the letter, in pertinent part:      The State Bar of Nevada has learned that criminals have forced their way into a State Bar storage facility and stolen some confidential records. Through investigation and in cooperation with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department we discovered that information furnished by you to the State Bar of Nevada may have been stolen. The State Bar has taken measures to secure all records to counter subsequent thefts and breaches in security.",
