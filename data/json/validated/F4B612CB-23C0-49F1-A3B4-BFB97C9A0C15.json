The company said in an updated statement on Saturday it was making \u201csteady progress\u201d in its recovery but still did not have a \u201ctimeline for restoration.\u201d\n\nImmediate impact was felt in the United Kingdom, where two of the four biggest grocery chains told CNN they were taking steps to deal with the outage.\n\n\u201cWe have reverted to a backup process but the outage has caused the smooth flow of goods to our stores to be impacted,\u201d said a spokesperson for Morrisons, which has nearly 500 grocery stores across the United Kingdom.\n\nSome of the biggest U.S. grocery chains use Blue Yonder, including Albertsons \u2014 the parent company of chains like Safeway and Jewel-Osco \u2014 and Kroger, the parent company of chains like Ralphs and Fred Meyer. Albertsons and Kroger did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\"",
