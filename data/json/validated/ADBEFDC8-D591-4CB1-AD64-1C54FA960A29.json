  "summary": " Two computer discs holding the personal details of all families in the UK with a child under 16 have gone missing.  The Child Benefit data on them includes name, address, date of birth, National Insurance number and, where relevant, bank details of 25 million people.    The chancellor blamed mistakes by junior officials at HMRC, who he said had ignored security procedures when they sent information to the National Audit Office (NAO) for auditing.  Mr Darling told MPs: \"Two password protected discs containing a full copy of HMRC's entire data in relation to the payment of child benefit was sent to the NAO, by HMRC's internal post system operated by the courier TNT.  The package was not recorded or registered. It appears the data has failed to reach the addressee in the NAO.\" ",
