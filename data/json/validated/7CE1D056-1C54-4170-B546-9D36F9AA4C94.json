As a result of this incident, a threat actor gained unauthorized access to the Salesforce database, which we use for customer support and internal case management. This database contains customer contact information, support case metadata, and the contents of support case communications.\n\nAt this time, we have no evidence that any PowerSchool infrastructure or production systems outside of Salesforce were affected by this incident; all other products and systems appear to remain fully secure and uncompromised.\n\nThe main motivation for the attacker appears to have been to steal credentials, per published information on the incident by Salesloft. If you suspect that your organization may have included credentials in a support case, we recommend that you review your support cases and change any credentials you find.\"",
