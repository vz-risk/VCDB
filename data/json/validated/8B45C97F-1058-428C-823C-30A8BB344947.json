  "summary": "It looks like Texas-headquartered Visionworks Inc. may have reported a second breach to HHS.  Readers may recall that earlier this month, Visionworks issued a statement about a breach affecting 75,000 patients. That involved a server reportedly lost in June during an upgrade.  But now it seems the Highmark subsidiary has also reported a breach involving theft of data (or a server itself) that occurred on or was discovered on October 17th. That theft reportedly affected 47,683 patients.  PHIprivacy.net emailed Visionworks on Wednesday to ask them for a statement or clarification about the second entry on HHSs public breach tool but has received no response as yet.  So_ is this a clarification/correction on their first report or a second breach?  It would be nice to know, wouldnt it?",
