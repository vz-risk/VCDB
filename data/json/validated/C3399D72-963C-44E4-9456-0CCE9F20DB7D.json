  "summary": "We recently identified another targeted attack campaign that leveraged both the recently announced Internet Explorer zero-day, CVE-2013-1347, as well as recently patched Java exploits CVE-2013-2423 and CVE-2013-1493. This campaign appears to have affected a number of victims based on the use of the Internet Explorer zero-day as well as the amount of traffic observed at making requests to the exploit server. This attack was likely executed by an actor we have named the Sunshop Group. This actor was also responsible for the 2010 compromise of the Nobel Peace Prize website that leverage a zero-day in Mozilla Firefox.",
