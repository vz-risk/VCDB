Patient A stated he had been seen in the ER on Saturday but the medications listed on the sheet he was given from the ER were incorrect. The AOD then checked Patient A's ER sheet and discovered it was actually a progress note that belonged to Patient B and contained Patient B's name, social security number, date of birth and medical information.",
