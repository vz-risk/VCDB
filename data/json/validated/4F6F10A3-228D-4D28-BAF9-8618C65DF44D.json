UnityPoint opened a review and discovered that an individual employed by a third-party company and not authorized to access the system, had gained access to the EMR system by using a password of individuals who were authorized to access the system for medical purposes.      The unauthorized access occurred from February through August 2013. Information that may have been accessed for the impacted patients include names, home addresses, dates of birth, medical and health insurance account numbers and health information related to patient treatment.
