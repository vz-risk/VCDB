  "summary": "In 2003, the appropriate OIG was notified that an employee had possibly violated USSID 18.  A female foreign national employed by the U.S. Government, with whom the subject was having sexual relations, told another government employee that she suspected that the subject was listening to her telephone calls.  The other employee reported the incident.  The investigation determined that, from approximately 1998 to 2003, the employee tasked nine telephone numbers of female foreign nationals, without a valid foreign intelligence purpose, and listened to collected phone conversations while assigned to foreign locations.  The subject conducted call chaining on one of the numbers and tasked the resultant numbers.  He also incidentally collected the communications of a U.S. person on two occasions.",
