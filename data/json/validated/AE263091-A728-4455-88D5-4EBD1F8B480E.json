The damage affected servers that stored personal and health information for Service Alberta, Alberta Treasury Branches, Alberta Health and Alberta Health Services.  The AHS electronic network and its backup system were knocked out for 36 hours. That led to lab services delays, major paper record backlogs and the cancellation of more than 100 elective surgeries at Calgary hospitals. But at issue is the fact staff resorted to sharing information over personal email and cellphones outside a secure network.",
