  "summary": "A Windsor obstetrician is warning her patients of a possible privacy breach four months after a computer full of sensitive information was stolen from her office.  In a public notice that appeared in The Star on Wednesday, Dr. Shobhana Patel said a break-in this summer resulted in the loss of a computer containing the personal health data of patients  namely names, addresses, contact information and health card numbers, as well as OHIP billing codes.  While the computer was password protected, I have no way of knowing whether the perpetrators have accessed the information contained on the stolen computer, Patel said in the notice.",
