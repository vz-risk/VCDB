  "summary": "Three (3) DICOM imaging DVDs (X-rays) were hand carried to the front desk of a Portland VA CBOC and turned over to VA staff. The Veteran presenting them indicated the DVDs had been mailed to him by mistake and he was returning them so they could be mailed correctly. This Veteran was not identified. The clinic staff sent the DVDs via inter-office mail to the Emergency Room Department in the main medical center. Employees brought them to the facility Privacy Officer after they had been in the department for multiple days.  The media were not in the original envelope so we do not know who they had been mis-mailed to. It is unknown how long this Veteran had the DVDs in his possession before he took them to the clinic.  Release of Information records show an authorized release request was submitted to their office on Feb 16, 2011. This is likely when the Imaging Department was forwarded the request so they could create the DVDs and mail them out. Imaging has been notified of the error and is checking to see what information they have related to this release.  The Privacy Officer currently has the media secured in his office.",
