  "summary": "EasyDraft, which processes payments for Bright Horizons Family Solutions, recently began notifying an undisclosed number of current and former Bright Horizons customers that their names, bank routing numbers and bank account numbers were mistakenly made available online (h/t DataBreaches.net).  According to the notification letter [PDF], Bright Horizons learned on January 8, 2014 that one of EasyDraft's internal Web sites was accessible online, and informed EasyDraft of the issue.  The Web site in question was then shut down, and an investigation determined that the Web server storing the files had been misconfigured since October 8, 2012, \"resulting in a lack of proper secure authentication requirements,\" according to EasyDraft.",
