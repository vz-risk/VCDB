  "summary": "There's been a potential leak of personally identifiable information from Instagram, but it's not clear yet whether the data came directly came from the social media company.  Security researcher Anurag Sen found a database online that appeared to contain profile data for 49 million Instagram users, including their email addresses and phone numbers - data that is supposed to be private. Instagram has at least 1 billion active monthly users.  Sen brought the database to the attention of TechCrunch, which traced the owner to Mumbai-based Chtrbox, a social media company. The database, which was hosted on Amazon Web Services, was left open without password protection on the internet. Chrtbox has since pulled it offline. ",
