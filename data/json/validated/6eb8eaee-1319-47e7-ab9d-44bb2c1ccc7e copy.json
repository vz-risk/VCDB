  "summary": "A database belonging to marketing automation platform provider Maropost Inc. has been found exposed online, complete with 95 million individual customer email records and email logs.  Discovered by researchers at Cybernews, the database included more than 19 million unique email records belonging to about 10,000 clients. Those clients include the New York Post, Shopify Inc., Fujifilm Holding Corp., Hard Rock Cafe Inc. and Mother Jones.  For once, the database wasn\u2019t found on an Amazon Web Services Inc. server but a Google Cloud server located in the U.S.  The researchers attempted to reach out to Maropost to inform it that the database was exposed two months ago and despite ongoing attempts were unable to get anyone to respond. In the end, the researches decided to inform the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security of the data breach.  They eventually received a reply April 1 from Maropost Chief Executive Officer Ross Andrew Paquette, who claimed that the email addresses in the database were randomized data the company used for external testing. The researchers noted, however, that their tests showed this not to be the case because the emails were real and deliverable.  \u201cLike the vast majority of breaches, it is rooted in the company\u2019s failure to do the basics well \u2014 the basics of security policies and standards, architecture and design, security assessment, and employee awareness,\u201d Kelly White, chief executive officer of risk assessment firm RiskRecon Inc., told SiliconANGLE.  \u201cIt is also rooted in the failure of Maropost\u2019s customers to hold them accountable to operating a strong security risk management program,\u201d Kelly added. \u201cCompanies must operate robust third-party security risk management programs that hold their vendors accountable to implementing good security practices. Companies that don\u2019t do so are going to be doing business with insecure vendors and their data is going to be compromised.\u201d  Balaji Parimi, CEO of cloud security platform company CloudKnox Security Inc., noted that cloud resource misconfigurations have become one of the biggest threats to enterprises.  \u201cThere\u2019s a simple reason these vulnerabilities are so prevalent: the complexity of multi-cloud environments, combined with a lack of visibility into who can do what, when and where,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen combined, this leads to identities with excessive high-risk permissions operating in environments where security teams can\u2019t answer simple questions like: \u2018What permissions does each service account or employee have?\u2019 and \u2018What actions have they performed?\u2019\u201d",
