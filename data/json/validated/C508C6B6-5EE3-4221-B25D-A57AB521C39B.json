  "summary": "Veteran A reported to the local Patient Advocate he received mail for Veteran B at his address. The Veterans addresses are correct in the record and an appointment for Veteran A was scheduled minutes before an appointment for Veteran B was cancelled. The Privacy Officer (PO) has spoken to Veteran A on the phone and he does not recall where he put the letter he received with his. He has been asked to mail it back to the facility if he locates it. The employee who made the appointment changes has indicated the mis-mailed letter would have been a cancellation letter with Veteran Bs name, last 4 of his SSN, full mailing address and the title of the clinic appointment that was cancelled.",
