  "summary": "State employees' personal information could be in the wrong hands after letters were recently sent to notify them of a data breach.  \"We want our members to know what happened,\" said Joan Williams with the Tennessee Benefits Administration. \"We wanted to let them know that some of their data was accessed. No Social Security numbers were accessed, no financial information and no medical information.\"  Williams said information taken centers around state employees who took part in wellness screenings in 2013.  Someone got into the computer systems of Onsite Health Diagnostics, a third-party vendor used by the state. Email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, genders and dates of birth were all reportedly stolen.  \"It was a data table with some certain information for our members who are involved in wellness screenings as part of the health plan,\" Williams said.  The hackers got information on more than 60,000 state employees.  Onsite Health Diagnostics said the data was taken between January and April of this year. Once made aware, Williams said the company launched an investigation.  \"It was an old computer system,\" Williams said. \"They have a new computer system in place with new securities.\"  Onsite Health Diagnostics is offering free identity theft protection for those affected. So far, authorities are not aware of any identity theft related to this data breach.
