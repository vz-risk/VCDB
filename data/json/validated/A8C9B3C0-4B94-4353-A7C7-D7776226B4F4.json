  "summary": " Iowa officials say personal information from more than 800 Medicaid clients was accidentally mailed to the wrong health clinic.  Iowa Medicaid Enterprise, a division of the state Department of Human Services, says Friday the error occurred during the mailing process. Patient listings were mailed in February.  The listings include the patient's name, phone numbers, state identification and type of enrolled program.  Iowa Medicaid Director Jennifer Vermeer says the listings were destroyed, and there's a low probability the information was compromised.  Iowa Medicaid Enterprise says it plans to stop mailing patient listings to providers beginning in May. Providers will be required to download the listings from a secure web portal. ",
