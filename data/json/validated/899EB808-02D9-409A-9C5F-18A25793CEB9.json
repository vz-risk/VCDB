  "summary": "A Brewton woman was indicted on more than 70 charges of theft and identity theft after she allegedly used patient information to file false insurance claims. Subrina Barlow is charged with 35 counts of theft of property II deception of the elderly, four counts of theft of property II and 37 counts of identity theft, said District Attorney Steve Billy. Barlow was brought before District Judge Jeff White Monday and given a $211,350 bond in the case. Ms. Barlow was employed at D.W. McMillan Hospital in the business office, Billy said. She handled insurance claims. What she did (allegedly) was used patient medical records to file those claims on herself and get paid for them. Her bond amount is the same as the restitution amount, he said. Barlow remains in the Escambia County Detention Center.",
