  "summary": "\"The Washington Post said it was affected by a wider breach tied to Oracle\u2019s E-Business Suite, joining a growing list of victims. The vulnerability was reportedly exploited by the Cl0p ransomware gang, which demands payment from victims in exchange for not leaking stolen files.\n\nOracle, a major enterprise software provider, disclosed in October that a zero-day flaw in its E-Business Suite had been exploited over the summer. Google also warned that Oracle systems were being targeted in what appeared to be a broader wave of data theft attempts. An initial emergency patch on 2 October failed, and a second critical fix on 11 October left customers exposed for days.\n\nCl0p\u2019s campaign has already hit high-profile targets including Harvard University, Envoy Air, DXC Technology and Chicago Public Schools. The group, active since at least 2019, previously abused MOVEit, GoAnywhere and Cleo file-transfer tools.\"",
