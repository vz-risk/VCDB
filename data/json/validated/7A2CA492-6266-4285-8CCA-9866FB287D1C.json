  "summary": "Operation Troy Incident 4: South Korea was hit by a major cyberattack on March 20, 2013, at 2:00 pm local time. This cyberattack caused a significant amount of damage to the affected organizations by wiping the hard drives of tens of thousands of computers. Analysis of this attackknown first as Dark Seoul and now as Operation Troyhas revealed that in addition to the data losses of the MBR wiping, the incident was more than cybervandalism. The attacks on South Korean targets were actually the conclusion of a covert espionage campaign.",
