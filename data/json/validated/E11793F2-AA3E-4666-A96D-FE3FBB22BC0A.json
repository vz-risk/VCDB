  "summary": "Anonymous hacktivists have temporarily disrupted the official website of Mexicos House of Representatives (diputados.gob.mx).   The attack was announced around 14 hours ago by the hackers. Currently, the website of the House of Representatives appears to be working properly.  In addition, the hacktivists claim to have breached the systems of Pemex, the Mexican state-owned petroleum company.  The attackers have leaked email addresses, names, phone numbers and addresses allegedly stolen from the companys systems. Anonymous hackers claim the details belong to Pemex employees.  The attack on Plemex comes in light of numerous protests. Many Mexicans dont agree with the countrys president, who wants to privatize the company.  In the meantime, the hackers threaten that this is only the beginning of their operation against the government. ",
