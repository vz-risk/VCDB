  "summary": "McKenzie Greener, who Spokane Police say stole the identity of an 88-year-old woman and more than $13,000 from her, was arrested Tuesday and made a first appearance in court Wednesday.  Police say Greener worked for Advantage Physical Therapy in the late Spring, and that's when she gained access to Mary Heinzerling's information. Heinzerling was a patient there at the time, and Greener, who worked the front desk, had her medical records and a check, according to court documents.  Greener stole more than $13,000 from Heinzerling in July, then attempted to open multiple credit card accounts in the following weeks, according to court documents. Police searched Greener's home yesterday, and say they found information from other people who had applied for jobs at the physical therapy office, though they have no evidence anyone else's information has been compromised.   Greener faces charges of 1st degree theft and 1st degree identity theft.",
