  "summary": "The Social Security numbers of nearly 200 students who paid tuition for education programs could be compromised, according to a letter sent out recently by the Polk County School District.  Pennie Zuercher, director of financial reporting for the district, said that between 150 and 200 1098T tax forms out of 2,000 were sent to incorrect addresses. The form includes the Social Security number of the student.  The problem occurred when a batch of 1098T forms, which are printed three per page, were folded and placed in envelopes by one of several clerks, rather than separated, Zuercher said.  \"Whoever was on top was who it got mailed to,\" she said. \"The problem is fairly small. But we don't have an exact number (of students).\"",
