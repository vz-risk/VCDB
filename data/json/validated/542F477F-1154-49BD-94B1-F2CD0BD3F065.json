  "summary": "Federal prosecutors say a coastal Georgia woman has been convicted in a $4 million Medicaid fraud and identity theft scheme.  Authorities said Wednesday that 47-year-old Schella Logan Hope, of Brunswick, has been convicted of money laundering, aggravated identity theft and health care fraud.  Prosecutors say Hope was a dietician who ran a coastal Georgia business between 2005 and 2011. Authorities say Hope stole the identities of children who were enrolled in Head Start programs throughout the state.  Authorities say Hope used the children's identities to file fraudulent prescriptions and Medicaid claims.  Officials say Hope used the money to pay for luxury cars, designer clothes, vacations and more.  Hope's co-defendant, Arlene Murrell, has already pleaded guilty in the case and testified against Hope.  Hope has yet to be sentenced.",
