  "notes": "Though the victim name is Hootsuite Media, the service is known simply as Hootsuite. It's not clear that the actor motive is \"Financial\", though that's what is speculated on based on a 3rd-party source from Cloudflare quoted in the article, so I classified it as \"Unknown\". Hootsuite Media has 300+ employees per Wikipedia. According to http://threatpost.com/hootsuite-back-online-following-denial-of-service-attack/104975 several days later, a malicious actor flooded its services and brought its dashboard and mobile APIs offline.",
