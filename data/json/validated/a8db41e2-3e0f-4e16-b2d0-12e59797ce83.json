This is customary in business transactions when customers only carry out their contract processing, including invoice receipt, online.  The problem with this one-e-mail: It was sent with an open mailing list, that is, the e-mail addresses of 20 customers were freely visible. Like telephone numbers or addresses, e-mail addresses are considered as personal data and may only be given to third parties with the consent.",
