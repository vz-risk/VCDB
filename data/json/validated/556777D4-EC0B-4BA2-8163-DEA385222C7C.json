  "summary": "Miami Beach Healthcare Group LTD dba Aventura Hospital and Medical Center in Florida reported 2,560 patients had PHI stolen from their EMR between January 1, 2012 and September 12, 2012.   Hospital statement: On September 7, 2012 law enforcement notified Aventura Hospital, stating that documents containing patient information had been stolen from the facility. Law enforcement believes these records were stolen for the possible purpose of identity theft. Aventura Hospital and Medical Center is committed to the proper handling and protection of patient information, and we are working closely with law enforcement to investigate and identify the individuals responsible for the theft. We have contacted those affected and we are taking steps to mitigate risk to affected patients such as providing free credit monitoring for one year. In addition, we are initiating new guidelines to further ensure the protection of patient information in the future.",
