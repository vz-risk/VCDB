  "notes": "Dr. Nisar Quraishi, who operated a practice at 1 Chopin Court in Jersey City, believes the number of missing records is in the range of 5,000 to 10,000  not 40,000 as he originally stated to authorities, said Carly Baldwin, a spokeswoman for the city Police Department.  Update of Nov. 7: the breach was reported to HHS as affecting 20,000 patients, but theres no indication whether this number was reported before or after the revised estimate of 5-10,000. The incident was also reported to HHS as being in NY, when it was in NJ.",

  "summary": "A New Jersey doctors storage shed was reportedly broken into and 40,000 patient records were stolen.  The case of a potential health data breach in New Jersey has grown stranger throughout the week.  On Tuesday, Dr. Nisar A. Quraishi found that both latches on the shed door of his offices storage facility had been cut with an unknown cutting tool. Upon entering, Quraishi told police he quickly saw that all of the medical records of patients he had treated between 1982 and 2009  and may still be treating  had been stolen.  According to The Jersey Journal, approximately 40,000 patient records containing protected health information (PHI) were missing. The records reportedly included patients Social Security numbers, dates of birth, home addresses and medical histories.  Quraishi said he had no idea who broke into the shed and that he had not been to the property since Aug. 10, at which point the shed was still secure, the news source reported. Quraishi reportedly first became aware of the issue when he was contacted by a neighborhood resident that the lock was broken. Additionally, Quraishi told police he was unable to immediately provide any of the names of the patients whose records were stolen from the shed.  There were no security cameras or witnesses in the area or at the scene, according to police officers.  On Wednesday, the Journal reported that the first floor of Quraishis office is a gutted, empty space with exposed beams and no carpet. Neighborhood residents said that they werent even aware that a break-in had occurred in the first place.",
