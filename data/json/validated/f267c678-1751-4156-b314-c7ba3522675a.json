  "summary": "A political campaign group working to elect Democratic senators left on an exposed server a spreadsheet containing the email addresses of 6.2 million Americans.  Data breach researchers at security firm UpGuard found the data in late July, and traced the storage bucket back to a former staffer at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, an organization that seeks grassroots donations and contributions to help elect Democratic candidates to the U.S. Senate.  Following the discovery, UpGuard researchers reached out to the DSCC and the storage bucket was secured within a few hours. The researchers shared their findings exclusively with TechCrunch and published their findings.",
