Based on the company\u2019s official filing, the incident resulted in an unauthorized party gaining access to consumers\u2019 names, addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, driver\u2019s license numbers, state ID numbers, military ID numbers, bank account numbers, routing numbers, and account types. After confirming that consumer data was leaked, Dollar Bank began sending out data breach notification letters to all individuals who were impacted by the recent data security incident. ",
