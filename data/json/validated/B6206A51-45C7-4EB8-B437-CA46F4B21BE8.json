  "summary": "Sixty two (62) Patients-A received a Medline Industries medical supply intended for sixty two (62) Patients-B. Sixty two (62) of Patient-Bs' name, address, and type of medical supply were compromised. Patients-A reported the incident to their medical centers and a replacement has been requested for Patients-B. Great Lakes Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) investigation concludes that this was a Medline packing error. On 04/13/15, Medline Industries installed a new automated system for applying shipping labels to CMOP packages which did not work properly therefore causing these mismailings. The packing errors have been reported to Medline for investigation and corrective action.",
