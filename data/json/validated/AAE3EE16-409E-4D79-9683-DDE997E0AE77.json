  "summary": "On November 4, 2014, an employees vehicle was broken into in Fresno, California and a password protected laptop and external hard drive were stolen from the vehicle. Fortunately, the theft was discovered within an hour of its occurrence and the Fresno Police Department was immediately notified and a formal police report was filed.  Physicians Skin & Weight Centers has security measures in place and we routinely delete information from electronic devices. However, we believe some patients personal information was on a device at the time of the incident. Specifically, the following information belonging to some of our patients was potentially exposed: Images taken during the course of their treatment with their first and/or last name; and some patients name on a company invoice. Also, a limited number of patients had banking information including full routing numbers, account numbers, and/or credit card numbers; and/or a copy of our financing application detailing some patients social security number, date of birth, mailing address, email address, income, rent payment, and employers name potentially exposed.  Though there is no evidence that any patients information has been used, we are taking this matter very seriously and are reexamining our practices. To help protect our affected patients, we have arranged to have AllClear ID protect their identity for 12 months at no cost to the patients, starting on the date of this notice. Our affected patients can use the services at any time during the next 12 months. ",
