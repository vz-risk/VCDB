  "summary": "A Naples man has pleaded guilty to multiple federal charges related to a Medicare fraud scheme between 2009 and 2012 involving Sunshine Pharmacy and Sunshine Solutions Pharmacy in Collier County.  Adam Parrish, 35, admitted to seven counts of conspiracy to commit health care fraud, three counts of aggravated identity theft and three counts of improper use of a Drug Enforcement Agency registration number. Parish faces up to 10 years in prison for the conspiracy charges, two years for each identity theft count and four years for use of the DEA number.  No sentencing date has been set.  According to the U.S. Attorneys Office, Parrish conspired with Delmer Holmes Parrish and Patricia Harris to defraud the government out of $351,358 by submitting fraudulent Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE prescription claims.  These prescriptions had not been filled or authorized by licensed physicians, investigators said. Some were made fraudulently in the name of beneficiaries without their knowledge and those who were already dead, they said. Parrish also admitted to using DEA numbers to obtain controlled substances.  Delmer and Patricia Parrish were sentenced in April 2014. Delmer Parrish, the owner of Sunshine Pharmacy, surrendered his pharmacist license and was sentenced to two years in prison. Patricia Parrish, Delmers Parrishs mother, was sentenced to 120 days of house arrest and three years of probation.  The Parrishs additionally paid $351,358 in restitution. ",
