  "summary": "One-hundred twenty-one (121) Patients-A received a Medline Industries medical supply intended for one-hundred twenty-one (121) Patients-B. One-hundred twenty-one (121) of Patient-Bs' name, address, and type of medical supply was compromised. Patients-A reported the incident to their medical centers and a replacement has been requested for Patients-B. Charleston Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) investigation concludes that this was a Medline packing error. On 04/13/15, Medline Industries installed a new automated system for applying shipping labels to CMOP packages which did not work properly therefore causing these mismailings. The packing errors have been reported to Medline for investigation and corrective action.",
