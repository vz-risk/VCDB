  "summary": "Earlier today news spread that social application site RockYou had suffered a data breached that resulted in the exposure of over 32 Million user accounts. To compound the severity of the security breach, it was found that RockYou are storing all user account data in plain text in their database, exposing all that information to attackers.   This matter now appears worse than originally suspected as the dataset also contains a table where RockYou have stored user credentials for social networks and other partner sites.  The database consists of a table containing partner data, and another table that has stored the credentials for those partner sites that users have entered. This includes social networks such as MySpace but also webmail accounts.",
