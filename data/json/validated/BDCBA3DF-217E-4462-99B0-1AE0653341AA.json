  "summary": "A Kilkenny Dil Deputy says the HSE locally has seriously breached Data Protection.  John McGuinness says it was brought to his attention that there are boxes of patient and HSE workers' files stored in unlocked outhouses at the site of their auxiliary hospital on Wolfe Tone Street in Kilkenny.  He told KCLR that he has now made a formal complaint to both the HSE and the Data Protection Commissioner because the files are easily accessible by the public.  Speaking to KCLR News, Deputy McGuinness says they should have been properly secured.",
