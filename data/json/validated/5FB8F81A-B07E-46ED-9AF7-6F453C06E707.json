  "summary": "The breach of online gambling site Betfair is alarming to banking institutions and security experts because the company waited 18 months to report the incident.  Betfair's systems breach, which occurred in March and April 2010, was not uncovered until this past May, when a server crashed. Now Betfair says cyberattackers likely gained access to the credit and debit details affiliated with 2.3 million customers.  Around 3.15 million usernames also were exposed, as were security questions. And 2.9 million of those usernames had physical addresses associated with them. Approximately 90,000 had bank account details attached. ",
