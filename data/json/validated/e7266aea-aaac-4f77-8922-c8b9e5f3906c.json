  "summary": "On Wednesday, the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner released its report on a 2015 case that saw 49 AHS employees improperly access the records of a patient and the patient\u2019s daughter at Calgary\u2019s South Health Campus.  The privacy breach revolved around a Calgary woman with terminal cancer who gave a fatal dose of drugs to her 19-year-old daughter with Down syndrome. The mother died in November 2015.  More than 160 employees accessed the records but 49 were found to have done so outside of their duties, with many citing \u201ccuriosity\u201d as their reason.",
