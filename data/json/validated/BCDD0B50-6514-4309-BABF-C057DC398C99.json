  "summary": "Police have identified 37-year-old Heidy Tirado of Fairfield as the former employee of Inland Family Care  Unity whos accused of stealing credit and debit card information from patients and using the information to make online purchases totaling more than $1,000.  A Troy resident complained to the Waldo County Sheriffs Department that an unauthorized charge had been made on a debit card on Dec. 17, according to a press release from the sheriffs department.  The investigation led to the arrest of Tirado on Friday. She has been charged with class C theft and was taken to the Waldo County Correctional Center. She has been released on $10,000 unsecured bail.  Inland Family Care  Unity is part of Waterville-based Inland Family Care. The company fired Tirado on Friday, the same day she was arrested.  In a prepared statement last week, John Dalton, Inland Hospitals president and CEO, said the hospital system was deeply shocked and disheartened that a member of our team appears to have violated our patients trust and ours.  Dalton said that the problem was likely limited to a small number of patients who paid for services at the Unity practice with a credit or debit card in the last six months. Patients who had billing contact with Tirado would be alerted, Dalton said.  We are currently auditing our bill paying process and instituting additional controls to safeguard all future payments, the statement said. We want to ensure this never happens again.",
