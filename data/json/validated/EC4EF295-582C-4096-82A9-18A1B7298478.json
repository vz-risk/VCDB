  "summary": "On February 26, 2016, the company contracted to provide patient satisfaction surveys for the MMG determined that an e-mail survey sent to numerous patients included incorrect information. The surveys were sent to the e-mail addresses of patients who visited MMG physicians from December 1 through December 31, 2015. The subject line of the e-mail stated the name of an individual that did not match the name of the individual to whom the e-mail was addressed. Within the body of the survey, the individual who received the e-mail was asked about their experience with a physician they had visited in recent weeks, but indicated that the physician worked in a different practice from the practice where the physician actually works.",
