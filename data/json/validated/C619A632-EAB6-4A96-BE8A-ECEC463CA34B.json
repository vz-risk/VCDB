How many victims? Not yet determined, a spokesperson told SCMagazine.com on Tuesday.   What type of personal information? Names, addresses, dates of birth, dates of service, Social Security numbers and clinical information may have been compromised for clients. Names, Social Security numbers and bank account information may have been compromised for employees.  What happened? Unauthorized access was gained to a server that stored the personal information.  What was the response? Upon discovery of suspicious activity, DPHHS shut down the impacted server and contacted law enforcement. A new server containing backup files is being brought online. DPHHS has purchased additional software to better protect sensitive information. DPHHS policies and procedures are being reviewed. All impacted individuals are being notified and offered a free year of credit monitoring and insurance offered by the state.
