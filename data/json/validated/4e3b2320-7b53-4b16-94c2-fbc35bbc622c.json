  "summary": "The data protection commissioner will be launching an investigation after a massive security vulnerability - in a database containing information on 337,384 voters from Malta that was being held by a Maltese IT company - led it to be exposed without security.  The data includes ID numbers, names, addresses, gender, phone numbers and dates of birth.  It accounts for around 75% of the Maltese population.  Screenshots posted on Twitter and a Reddit thread shows that the voter database was held by software developer C-Planet IT Solutions, in a folder called VotingDocumentSystem.  The company provides IT services for local councils Valletta, Bormla, Mdina, Isla, Birgu, St Paul\u2019s Bay, Ta\u2019 Xbiex, Marsaxlokk, Marsaskala, Birzebbugia, Floriana, Sliema, Santa Venera, Naxxar, and Qormi.
