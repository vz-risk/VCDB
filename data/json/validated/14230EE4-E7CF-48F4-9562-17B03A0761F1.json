  "summary": "A former VA employee, released a wait list to a reporter as a \"whistle blower.\"  The list had scheduled dates, last four digits of the SSN, and clinic\nnames. It is possible the list also had first and last name. The media used the list in reporting a story and had stated \"they have redacted protected health information (PHI)\" to protect the Veterans. However, it is unknown when and who redacted the information and how many unredacted lists could still be at large. This incident occurred in the Sleep Clinic, a clinic which previously had two missing laptops this year. It is unknown if this is related, but it is possible.",
