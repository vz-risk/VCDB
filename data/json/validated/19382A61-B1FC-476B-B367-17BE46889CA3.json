In looking into this matter, I discovered that Dr. Glick had been before the Ohio State Dental Board in February 2001 after his license was suspended in December 2000 due to drug-related charges. An investigators report, provided to the board, indicated that Dr. Glick had been arrested on charges involving possession of narcotics and aggravated menacing. Dr. Glick had reportedly confessed to a chemical dependency problem and had undergone a treatment program with aftercare. Dr. Glicks license to practice dentistry was reinstated by the board.   Dr. Glick also signed a consent order with the board in 2011 on unrelated matters.",

Between March 10 and Dec. 26, 2012, Dr. Fred Glick, 55, of Russell, used the computer network to obtain information on individuals who were not his current patients, including the woman, her lawyer and her current boyfriend. When the female patient broke off their relationship after six years and moved to another residence, Glick also used the OARRS database to obtain information as to where she was currently living. ",
