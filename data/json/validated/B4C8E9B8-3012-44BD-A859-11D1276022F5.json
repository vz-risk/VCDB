Court records show Troy police investigators arrested 28-year-old Jonathan Rofeal Collins on Monday, and charged him with 16 felony counts of identity theft.

Records also show the victims were from as many as seven different states from as far away as California to Michigan, Texas, Kentucky, Indiana, Florida and Alabama.
