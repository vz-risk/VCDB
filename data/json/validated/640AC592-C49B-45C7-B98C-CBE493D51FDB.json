  "summary": "An employee of a California skilled nursing facility was charged last week for reportedly filming a 90-year old resident as she and another employee helped her into the shower. LaToya Walker and another employee of LifeHOUSE Vista Healthcare Center in Vista, CA, were the subject of an October investigation by the Department of Justice after an anonymous source sent images from the Snapchat video to a local television station. The video allegedly depicted Walker and her coworker laughing as they helped the dementia resident get ready for a shower. Walker was charged last Wednesday with misdemeanor counts of elderly abuse and invasion of privacy. The other employee has not been named, but both have been fired from LifeHOUSE, Tom Allen, an attorney for the facility told 10News. The California Certified Nursing Assistant board revoked certification for one of the employees, and suspended the other for 30 days, Allen said.",
