  "summary": "In June, a healthcare assistant from St Luke\u2019s Hospital was accompanying a patient on a transfer to another hospital when he left their chart on the roof of the car before setting off.  He realised the mistake only when he arrived at their destination. The chart was later retrieved from a member of the public who had picked it up.  The HSE responded by notifying the patient of the incident and reported the matter to the Data Commissioner. The staff member was reminded of their responsibilities under data-protection legislation.",
