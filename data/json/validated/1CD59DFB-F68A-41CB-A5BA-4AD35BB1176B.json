  "summary": "The Syrian Electronic Army is back with another high-profile attack. This time, the pro-Assad group has hacked the Qatar Domains Registry (registry.qa) and altered the DNS records of several major domains.  The list of impacted websites is fairly long. It includes the .qa domains of Google, Vodafone, Facebook, Al Jazeera, Qatar Telecom, and Sheikha Mozah.  Domains of the following government and military organizations have also been defaced: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Qatar government portal, the Emirs Palace, the Qatar Armed Forces, and the Ministry of Interior.  The hackers website contains a large number of documents that appear to have been leaked from various Qatar government organizations.  Update. The Syrian Electronic Army has told me that they've targeted Qatar because the country supports the terrorists in Syria.",
