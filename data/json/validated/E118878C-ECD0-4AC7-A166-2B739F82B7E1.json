  "summary": "A physician in a Minneapolis VA Healthcare System Clinic had seen  a patient. During the visit it was determined that a form was required to be completed.  The physician left the room to obtain or to fill out the form. The physician failed to logoff from his workstation which displayed a CPRS data from a patient that he had treated earlier. An X-ray for the earlier patient was also visible on a PACs workstation in the same room. When the physician returned to the room, the current patient made a declaration that she had taken a photograph of the x-ray and if the physician had not filled out the form for her, she would have reported the physician for a HIPAA violation. She then displayed her cell phone and deleted what she told the physician was a picture of the x-ray.",
