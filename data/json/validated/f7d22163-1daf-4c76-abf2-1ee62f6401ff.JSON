Cardinal Contracting immediately launched an investigation, with the assistance of third-party forensic specialists, to determine the nature and scope of the activity.  Cardinal Contracting's investigation determined that there was unauthorized access to certain email accounts from September 9, 2020 to December 8, 2020.  Cardinal Contracting began reviewing the affected systems to determine what, if any, sensitive information was contained within them.  On June 22, 2021, Cardinal Contracting's review determined that the affected email accounts contained certain information related to certain individuals.  Please note that Cardinal Contracting is providing this information in an abundance of caution, as the investigation cannot confirm that information relating to specific individuals was actually accessed.
