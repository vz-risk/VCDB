  "summary": "A health technician was checking in a Veteran for his visit and was given his medicare cards to be scanned into the computer and the Veteran was called by the physician to be seen and the health technician told Veteran that they will make sure he is given his card back before the end of his appointment. Instead of walking to the office where the Veteran was being seen, the health technician decided to clip the cards onto the back of his clinical papers and some how the cards got lost. They did a thorough search around the area where the cards should have been and could not seem to be able to locate them. The technician is thinking that the cards were given to another Veteran and is trying to contact the other Veteran at this time to see if they mistakenly had given them to the patient.",
