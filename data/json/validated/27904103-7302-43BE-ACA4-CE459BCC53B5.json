  "summary": "A Veteran employee requested a copy of who accessed his medical electronic records. Once he received the list he questioned the access of four employees on the list. The Privacy Officer (PO) will investigate the reason for these employee accessing his records. The medical record contains the Veteran employee's name, full SSN and protected health information (PHI).  03/02/12:\nAfter investigation, the Privacy Officer found out of 4 employees only one had a legitimate reason to be in his records. One employee can recall why she went in his record. Another employee was in the wrong package to look up his telephone number (should have been in VIST under telephone number). The last employee cannot remember why he would go into this record. The PO is waiting for the employee to come back to work to discuss my findings.",
