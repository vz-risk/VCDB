  "summary": "An Indiana mental health organization is sending out HIPAA breach notification letters to about 45,000 people after one of its providers failed to encrypt laptops containing clients' medical data and Social Security numbers.  Several laptops were stolen from the administrative office of Aspire Indiana on Nov. 7, 2014.  An investigation found that emails on the laptops contained client and employees' Social Security numbers, names and addresses as well as personal health information of Aspire clients. 1,548 of those notified had their Social Security numbers compromised. The organization routinely collects data on HIV care data, substance abuse treatment and mental health services.    \"Our organization is committed to maintaining the privacy and security of the personal information in our control, and we sincerely regret this incident occurred,\" said Aspire's president and CEO Rich DeHaven, in a public notice. \"We have taken steps to enhance our security, including upgrading our alarm and security systems.\"",
