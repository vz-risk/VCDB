  "summary": "Australia has been accused by East Timor of bugging its offices during trade negotiations and has taken their case to International arbitration. Later, Australia raided the law offices of the firm representing East Timor to seize documents that might reveal the identity of the whistleblower.  That seizure was done legally, but also lends additional credence to the idea that Australia did engage in espionage to gain a strategic advantage during the talks.",
