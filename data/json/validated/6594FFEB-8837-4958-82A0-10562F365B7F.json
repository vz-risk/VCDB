  "summary": "An employee reported that she sent an email that was intended for a VA employee; however, the email somehow ended up being sent to a Veteran's personal \nemail address. The Veteran emailed the employee back indicating that it was sent in error. The email contained full name, last four of SSN, appointment time, and clinic for 14 patients. The Information Security Officer advised the employee that this could have been avoided if the email were encrypted and instructed the \nemployee to delete the unencrypted email from her inbox and deleted items folder.",
