  "summary": "The former chief operating officer at U.S. law firm Proskauer Rose planned to take a new job at competitor Paul Hastings before he was sued last month for allegedly stealing a trove of confidential documents, his lawyer said Monday.  Proskauer said in a lawsuit last month that its ex-COO John O\u2019Brien tricked firm employees into letting him copy sensitive data on clients, lawyer compensation and other matters and then wrongfully deleted thousands of emails before giving notice on Dec. 20 that he was quitting the firm.  \u201cWhile it is unfortunate that an apparent overreaction based on Proskauer's mistaken assumptions has improperly interfered with Mr. O'Brien's planned position at Paul Hastings, he nevertheless looks forward to resolving this entire matter quickly and continuing his successful career in the legal field,\u201d said O\u2019Brien\u2019s attorney Russell Beck, of Beck Reed Riden.  A Paul Hastings spokesman said on Monday that O'Brien is not joining the firm but declined to comment further, citing a policy not to discuss \"any firms' personnel matters.\"",
