  "summary": "North Carolina's Guildford County Schools (GCS) recently announced that an employee had mistakenly e-mailed a PDF file containing about 456 Page High School students' personal information to a student's guardian on July 2, 2013 (h/t DataBreaches.net).  The file included students' names, addresses, phone numbers, course enrollments, grades, school district identification numbers and other transcript data.  The school district learned of the error when the recipient realized the file was sent by mistake and contacted the employee.  \"We work very hard in GCS to protect student privacy and data, and we are very sorry that this has occurred,\" GCS superintendent Maurice O. Green said in a statement. \"Fortunately, this error was caught quickly so the exposure is limited. We are deeply appreciative to the individual receiving the e-mail for recognizing the error and notifying us so quickly.\"  Following the breach, Green said, GCS plans to strengthen the school district's sharing protocols, training and communications. Parents with questions are advised to call (336) 332-0810.",
