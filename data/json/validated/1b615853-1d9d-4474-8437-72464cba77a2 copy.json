  "summary": "A Health Share data breach has exposed the personal information of many of its members. This comes after a laptop was stolen from a company vehicle.     Advances in cybertechnology mean that a hacker can sit anywhere in the world and potentially break into a computer network. New methods and tactics have made it even easier for criminals to steal personal identifiable information (PII), medical records, complete identities and more.     However, that does not mean the threat from \u201cold-fashioned\u201d crimes has diminished. Health Share of Oregon has just announced a data breach of its members\u2019 PII\u2014including names, birthdates and Social Security numbers, but not medical records\u2014due to a laptop being stolen from a vendor\u2019s vehicle. The vendor, GridWorks, provides patient transportation to some Health Share members. A company vehicle was broken into and the laptop was stolen.     Health Share has not been able to determine whether or not the members\u2019 information has been used maliciously by the thief as part of the Health Share data breach. Therefore, the company is providing a year of credit monitoring and identity monitoring to its affected members.     Health Share is already taking proactive steps to prevent this kind of incident in the future. For example, they are conducting audits of their third-party vendors and implementing tech training for any vendors who are able to access member information.   ",
