  "summary": "The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine today announced it is mailing notification letters to an estimated 3,716 persons whose information may have been affected in a cyber phishing incident involving some School of Medicine email accounts.  A leading independent forensic firm conducted a lengthy and extensive review that concluded on Sept. 13, 2019, and confirmed that an unauthorized third party gained access to several email accounts during the approximate timeframe of May 17, 2018, to June 18, 2018. This review confirmed that some patients\u2019 personal information was contained in the affected email accounts, possibly related to treatments received when they were seen by a UNC physician.",
