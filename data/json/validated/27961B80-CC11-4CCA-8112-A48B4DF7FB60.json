The breach exploited vulnerabilities in Salesforce-connected systems, potentially exposing personal information from customer databases. For Dior customers, the incident highlights how even premium retailers can become targets in large-scale cyberattacks.  The Salesforce incident originated with a third-party OAuth exploit, where attackers manipulated authentication tokens used by connected applications. This allowed unauthorized access to data stored in Salesforce\u2019s customer relationship management (CRM) systems.\"",
