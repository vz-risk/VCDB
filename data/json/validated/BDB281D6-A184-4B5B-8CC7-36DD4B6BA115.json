  "summary": "A Wisconsin counseling center recently reported a data breach that may have exposed mental health records for approximately 500 individuals.  Fox River Counseling Center had an \"unsecured laptop\" stolen on October 23, according to The Northwestern. Outpatient mental health records of clients who visited the center from Nov. 7, 2012, to Aug. 19, 2014 were reportedly on the computer. Wisconsin Disability Determination Bureau psychological evaluations from May 13, 2013, to Oct. 21, 2015 were also included on the device.  Clinic psychologist Dr. Scott Trippe told the news source that client names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, medical histories, mental status interviews, results of psychological testing, diagnoses and statements of work capacity were all included on the laptop.  The center did not specify how the computer was \"unsecured,\" but said that it was an older model and has not yet been recovered. Since the incident the center reported that it \"upgraded security, including encryption software.\"",
