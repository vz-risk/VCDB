  "summary": "On 08/17/15 a Medical Support Assistant (MSA) was given a list of patients by the Acting Chief of Optometry to reschedule appointments. On 08/21/15, the MSA reported to his acting supervisor that the paperwork was missing. The MSA was asked to check with other staff members for its location and on 08/31/15 the MSA informed her supervisor that the paperwork is still missing. On 09/02/15, another search was conducted with no results. On 09/03/15 the Privacy Officer (PO) suggested that the Shred-it bins in the local area be checked, as it may have inadvertently been placed there. As suggested, the service requested that the bins be unlocked and a search was conducted with negative results. The list contained the first name, last name and full SSN.",
