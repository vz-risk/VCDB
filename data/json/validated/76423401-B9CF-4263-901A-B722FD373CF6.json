  "summary": "Based on Iron Mountains internal investigation conducted by members of its Global Security group, Iron Mountain believes some of the missing files were stolen through the actions of two individuals who were employees of Cornerstone Records Management, a company acquired by Iron Mountain. One of the two resigned in October 2013, when Iron Mountain acquired Cornerstone, and the second individuals employment was terminated by Iron Mountain in June 2014. Iron Mountain has determined that the vast majority of the missing storage records were x-ray files. As a result of this incident, Iron Mountain also conducted an audit of LBIMGs other records in storage, and determined that other records in storage with its predecessor, Cornerstone, were missing when Cornerstone vacated a storage facility in 2010. LBIMG has determined that some of these additional records included patient fee ticket records. Iron Mountain has notified us there is no information to indicate that the fee ticket records have been accessed or used by any unauthorized individual.  We are monitoring Iron Mountains continuing investigation of this matter. Iron Mountain is working in conjunction with the Riverside Police Department to investigate this matter, and Iron Mountain has requested that the theft of X-rays be criminally prosecuted. We have not received any indication from the Riverside Police Department that any information has been accessed or used by any unauthorized individual. UPDATE:  Rogue employees at Iron Mountain who victimized patients of Orthopaedic Specialty Institute Medical Group, Long Beach Internal Medical Group, and The Hand Care Center / Shoulder and Elbow Institute also victimized 2,691 patients of Riverside Medical Clinic.  The total has been updated to reflect this change.",
