  "summary": "Potentially sensitive information about doctors has been added to the raft of email privacy blunders  many from government departments  during the past year. The Medical Council has apologised to about 2900 doctors after an attachment containing their payment information to the council was mistakenly emailed to a single doctor. The information could reportedly identify if doctors were paying more than their $733 yearly registration, which could mean money for disciplinary procedures or further training. The email was sent out in May last year when the wrong details were entered into the email fields.  In a letter to the affected doctors, chief executive Philip Pigou said the council had made changes to its email system to prevent it happening again. The Minster of Health, who the independent council reports to, and Privacy Commissioner had been informed, he said. The Ministry of Education on Saturday admitted it had emailed private information to the wrong person. This followed privacy leaks and breaches at the Earthquake Commission, ACC, Ministry of Social Development and Inland Revenue. ",
