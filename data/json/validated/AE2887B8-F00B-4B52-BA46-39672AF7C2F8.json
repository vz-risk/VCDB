This is the latest in a series of hacking incidents and data leaks being carried out by unknown badasses in protest against real name regulations for microblog sites and other online services in China.  The PSB confirmed the leak on, where else, Weibo, and said that steps have been taken to patch the vulnerability hackers used to gain access. It remains unknown what, or if any, portion of the leaked data belongs to individuals from outside of mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau, but search interfaces for the leaked database can be found online if youre inclined to find out.  Police have also said that an investigation is underway to find those responsible for the breach.",
