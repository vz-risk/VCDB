The skimming device, about the size of a pen, was found at the Shell gas station at 745 Horizon Drive.   This device is in addition to and different from the two devices that were found and removed from bank ATM locations last week.   If you used the gas pump at the Shell on Horizon recently, police urge you to check your statements closely for unauthorized used.  In the case of the Bank ATMs, police found and removed the device within a few hours. Police didn't say how long they suspect the device was installed at the gas station.   No suspects have been identified in the most recent gas station skimming incident, but Police do have two suspects for the Bank of Colorado ATM skimmer placements.   If you recognize any of the people in the surveillance photos, you're asked to call Crime Stoppers, 241-STOP or visit their website at 241STOP.com ",
