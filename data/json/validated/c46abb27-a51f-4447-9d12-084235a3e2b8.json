  "summary": "A paper file containing medical information for about 1000 patients has been stolen from a locked office at Health Sciences Centre.  Winnipeg Regional Health Authority Chief Operating Officer Real Cloutier says it happened in early October and police have been called in.  \u201cWe do have some footage in the general area that investigators are looking at,\u201d says Cloutier. \u201cIt was a secure area. The room where the information was enclosed had a lock so we don\u2019t think it was somebody from the public.\u201d  He adds that while the breach is still considered very serious, the information that was stolen was fairly minimal including patient names, birth dates, file numbers and the medical procedure they had done at the hospital.",
