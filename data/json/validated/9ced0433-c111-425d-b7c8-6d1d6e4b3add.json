Harding and his businesses also are not permitted to transport bodies from the Medical Examiner\u2019s Office to other funeral homes in the state.  \u201cThe basis of the suspension is the recent discovery that Tri-State Mortuary and/or the Gatens-Harding Funeral Home was in possession of confidential government documents that appear to have been removed from OCME personnel files and decedent case files,\u201d Izzo wrote in the letter. \u201cGiven the appearance of a potential breach of confidentiality and the unlawful taking and/or possession of confidential government documents, it is incumbent upon the Department of Health and Human Resources to initiate an investigation of the purported breach and unlawful taking/and or possession of confidential government documents.\u201d",
