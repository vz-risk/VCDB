  "summary": "Hospital staff have reportedly been fired after a privacy breach at Bluewater Health.  Multiple sources told The Observer Monday as many as 17 people were dismissed after non-clinical staff accessed patient information through a password-protected system  without authorization  earlier this month.  Sources told The Observer that at least part of the information accessed is related to the persons charged in the murder of 27-year-old Sarnia teacher Noelle Paquette.  Karen Waymouth, chief information and privacy officer, said she couldn't confirm whether employees were fired, citing the privacy and confidentiality of the investigation.  We do uphold a policy of confidentiality here and that we do have a policy in place if a breach occurs, she said. The appropriate action was taken.  Waymouth did not divulge specifics  what information was accessed, how many people were affected, what type of non-clinical staff were involved, or what they were doing with the information.  It's due to the privacy and confidentiality of the individuals, the people who's charts were accessed, and also the staff that were involved, she said.  Staff had access to the computer system because of their jobs at Bluewater Health, Waymouth said. The breach was confirmed after a random audit and employee interviews.  She did say fewer than 17 staff members were involved in the breach, but wouldn't confirm the exact number.  Waymouth contacted patients affected by the breach personally and apologized, she said, noting their reactions, when she called, were of disappointment.  The police were not notified, she said, but Bluewater Health was planning to contact the Information and Privacy Commission.  Mandatory orientation sessions at Bluewater Health cover privacy and confidentiality, and require employees, physicians, volunteers and students to sign a pledge of confidentiality  enforced by hospital policy and law, Bluewater Health officials said in a news release.  Patient confidentiality and patient care are part of a balancing act when it comes to personal information, Waymouth said.  Unauthorized or inappropriate access to electronic patient information is viewed with zero tolerance.  Staff are planning to re-educate all staff, students, volunteers and physicians about Bluewater Health's policy, she said, adding hospital officials do value and trust staff.  It's disappointing when a policy is not followed and we're unable to fulfill our obligation to protect patient privacy, she said.  This is the second time in recent years that Bluewater Health has reported a security breach.  In November 2010, 123 Bluewater Health patients' personal health records were breached by an employee at the West Lambton Community Health Centre, resulting in changes to auditing practices and staff access levels at both organizations.",
