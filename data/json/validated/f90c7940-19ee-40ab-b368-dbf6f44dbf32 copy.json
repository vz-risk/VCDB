In a notification statement, Woodlawn says on March 18, it suffered a ransomware attack on its computer systems.  \"We identified the attack almost immediately and were able to restore our systems from secure backup hard drives,\" the statement says, adding that no ransom was paid.  \"Although ransomware attacks do not typically access personal information, in an abundance of caution, we are letting individuals know that their health records were encrypted,\" the statement says.  Data potentially exposed in the breach include patients' names, addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth plus medical insurance and related health information, the practice says.  Woodlawn declined Information Security Media Group's request for additional details about the reported ransomware data breach.",
