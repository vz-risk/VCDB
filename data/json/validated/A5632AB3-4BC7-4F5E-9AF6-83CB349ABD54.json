  "summary": "According to a notice published on the companys website on Wednesday, its uncertain who is behind the attack. Their motives are also not known at this point, but the most likely scenario is that theyve been looking for some information they could monetize.   The cybercriminals have breached a web server that hosts only information on gas customers. Energie Steiermark is now trying to determine if any data has been stolen by the attackers. However, the company says that no financial information is stored on the breached machine.  The attack was discovered after an internal warning system had been triggered. Immediate steps were taken to limit the extent of the breach. State police and CERT Austria have been notified of the incident.",
