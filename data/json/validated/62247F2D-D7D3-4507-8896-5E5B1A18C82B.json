On Oct. 19, 2009, an anonymous hacker using a third IP address allegedly accessed the hospital's website. Using an employee's mailbox, the hacker then allegedly composed and sent an email to all hospital employees accusing more than one of the individual plaintiffs of sexual misconduct and other wrongdoing.
