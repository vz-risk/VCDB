  "summary": "A Chesapeake woman will spend more than five years in prison for her role in an identity theft scheme.  Shavika Thompson also must pay more than $99,000 in restitution.  The 36-year-old Thompson had pleaded guilty in September 2014 to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.  U.S. Attorney Dana J. Boente says Thompson was sentenced on Monday to 41 months on the conspiracy charge and two years on the identity theft charge. The sentences are consecutive.  According to court records, Thompson worked for a telephone answering and messaging service that catered to medical service practices and doctors. She and co-defendant Sheila Clark Lewis obtained patients' identity information from the company and used it to make fraudulent credit card purchases.  Clark is serving more than five years in prison.",
