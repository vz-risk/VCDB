  "summary": "St. Vincent Breast Center officials said patients health information may have been compromised after they sent around 63,000 letters to the wrong patients.  The letters included patient names, addresses, and in some cases, a reference to a scheduled appointment. Officials said none of the letters included social security numbers, financial information or clinical information.  St.Vincent Breast Center entered into an agreement with Indianapolis Breast Center P.C. and Solis Womens Health Breast Imaging Specialists of Indiana P.C. after they both closed last year.  On May 5, St.Vincent Breast Center mailed letters intended for prior patients of the Indianapolis Breast Center and Solis Womens Health to inform them that St.Vincent was available to provide care. Some letters also welcomed patients who had previously scheduled healthcare services.  Officials said on May 15, people who had accidentally received another persons letter began calling St.Vincent.  Rex McKinney, privacy officer for St.Vincent Indianapolis Hospital, said there is no indication that this patient information will be accessed or used.  We value the privacy and security of patient information, and regret this mailing error, said McKinney. It is our priority to support those who have been affected and make the necessary changes to our patient mailing process to avoid future occurrences. We sincerely apologize for any inconveniences resulting from this unfortunate incident.  The hospital is destroying letters that have been returned and changing its patient mailing process, according to McKinney.  ",
