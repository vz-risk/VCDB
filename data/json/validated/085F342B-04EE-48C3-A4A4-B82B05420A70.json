  "summary": "Five password-protected, but unencrypted laptop computers were stolen from Global Care Delivery, a business associate (BA) of the covered entity (CE), North Shore LIJ Health System in September 2014.  The laptops contained the protected health information (PHI) of 18,213 individuals, including names, dates of birth, insurance identification numbers (which contained social security numbers), and diagnoses and/or treatment codes related to claims.  The BA notified police at the time of the incident, but did not notify the CE until May 11, 2015.  The BA retained Knoll, Inc. to assist with individual notification and provide call center services to answer questions from individuals impacted by the breach.  Breach notification was provided to HHS and affected individuals, and the BA offered complimentary one-year identity theft protection services.  The business relationship between the CE and BA ended effective May 11, 2015. The BA has closed its business.",
