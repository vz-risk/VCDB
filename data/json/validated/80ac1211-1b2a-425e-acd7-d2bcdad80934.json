  "summary": "A data breach at the Wyoming Department of Health publicly exposed COVID-19, influenza and blood alcohol test data from more than a quarter of Wyomingites and some out of state residents, the department announced Tuesday.   The breach occurred when an employee erroneously uploaded files containing that data to the public code-hosting platform GitHub.  Data for more than 164,000 individuals was uploaded to the site, according to the health department.   More than 145,000 people affected are believed to be Wyoming residents who received a COVID-19 or influenza test between January 2020 and March 2021. Blood alcohol test data involved just over 18,000 people, most of whom are Wyoming residents, according to the health department. ",
