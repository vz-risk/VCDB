  "summary": "Two computer servers containing the records of almost 1m patients were stolen from the Childrens University hospital in Temple Street in 2007 and have never been recovered.  The data were far more than that lost on stolen bank laptops in recent years. The theft was investigated by the data protection commissioner (DPC) and the gardai after being reported by the Dublin hospital in February 2007. The organisations had decided that there was no need to inform the public, believing there was little chance of the thief being able to access the data.  Patients details, including names, date of birth and reason for admission are thought to have been included.",
