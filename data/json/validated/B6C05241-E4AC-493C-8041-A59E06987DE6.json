  "summary": "A Veteran initially called into the Director's Office to report both a HIPAA violation and to report how this Veteran was treated by a specific Nurse. The Privacy \nOfficer (PO) called the Veteran for additional information. The Veteran stated that this Nurse, in front of other Veterans and family members in the waiting area of a clinic, stated in a tone loud enough to be heard by others, the type of medication the Veteran was being prescribed. The Veteran stated the Nurse looked up his record in CPRS and the Veteran feels the Nurse should not have been in the Veterans record. The Veteran stated that this happened on more than one occasion, the first dating back 2 years ago, with the most recent occurrence happening last month (August 2011)",
