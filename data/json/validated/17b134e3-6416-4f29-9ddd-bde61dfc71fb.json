Xiang was working as a senior research and development engineer at ele.me, a leading online food ordering platform.  The company reported the leak to Putuo police at 11pm last Thursday after staff at its risk control department discovered that the data of its employees, including their names, sexes and mail addresses, had appeared on a website.",
