  "summary": "As posted on MetroPlus Health Plans web site:  Recently, MetroPlus Health Plan experienced a possible security breach involving some personal information (including name, member identification number, date of birth and social security number) of a number of our members. A MetroPlus employee, while attempting to work off site, sent an e-mail with this information to their personal e-mail account instead of their MetroPlus assigned e-mail account. This action was done in violation of MetroPlus policy and the appropriate disciplinary action has been taken.   There is no evidence that information has been misused, and we believe that the likelihood of such misuse is low. We informed affected members immediately about this incident, and have offered reimbursement of a one-year membership in Experians Triple Alert credit monitoring product to all impacted members.  MetroPlus takes the protection of personal information very seriously, and we have implemented additional measures to protect that information. We are committed to fully protecting all of the information entrusted to us. For additional information regarding this matter, please contact MetroPlus Customer Services at 1-855-544-0599 or email at Contact Us.  According to HHSs public breach tool, the incident occurred on September 6th, and 31,980 members were affected by the incident.",
