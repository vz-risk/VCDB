Cloudflare is an online content delivery network, which offers CDN, DNS, DDoS protection, and security.  Some usernames and passwords were leaked because of a security bug that affected 3,400 websites, including Uber, Fitbit, and OkCupid. However, 1Password has the end-to-end encryption, which means no data was exposed. The leaked passwords were cached by search engines, which recommends users to change it.",
