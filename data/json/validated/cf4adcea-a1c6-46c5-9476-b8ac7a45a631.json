  "summary": "A senior citizen who spent two months in intensive care at Brampton Civic Hospital (BCH) last year has filed a $1 million breach of privacy lawsuit against the William Osler Health System and a nurse.  Valerie Darragh, 77, is one of possibly hundreds of former patients who were notified the week of April 24 that their hospital identification numbers were allegedly accessed by \u201can employee\u201d for \u201cnon-hospital-related\u201d use.  Nurse Catharina Demme was charged by Peel police May 4 with using those patient numbers to steal Percocet.  \u201cWhen patients are in a hospital\u2019s care, they shouldn\u2019t have to worry about how their personal information is being treated,\u201d said Darragh\u2019s lawyer, Mike Smitiuch of Smitiuch Injury Law PC.  Darragh\u2019s medical records indicated she had been prescribed Percocet. She never got the painkiller, but she needed it, she said.",
