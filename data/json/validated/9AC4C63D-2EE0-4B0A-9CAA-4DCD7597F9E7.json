  "summary": "The Metro Public Health Department in Nashville, Tennessee is facing its second data breach since July 2014. Earlier this month, a file cabinet containing files on patients with HIV was accidentally sent to a Metro school. The files were supposed to be sent to a surplus warehouse, according to a local NBC affiliate.  The agency was notified of the mix-up by the school on Oct. 8. The news source reported that the health department is examining its process of how files are handled during a move. This incident is believed to have occurred when the agency moved into a new office space.  Moreover, the health department said it is taking steps to provide staff members with training on HIPAA laws, patient identification and security. The files that were sent to the wrong destination were almost a decade old, according to reports.",
