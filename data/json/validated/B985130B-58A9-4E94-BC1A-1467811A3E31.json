  "summary": "A man identifying himself as Veteran A presented himself in the Emergency Department asking for treatment. The man received a wristband with Veteran A's full name, full SSN and DOB when he was triaged and placed in an exam room to wait for the VA provider to see him. The man signed the intake document using Veteran A_s name. When the VA provider arrived at the room he noticed the man was not Veteran A because he had been treated by the provider before. The provider removed the wristband and notified the other VA staff that he was not the Veteran indicated. VA Police were called and responded to investigate. The man's correct name has been determined and a record has been created for him to document the humanitarian care he received.\nThe man was left alone with Veteran A's wristband information for a period of time, but it is now known if he recorded or memorized the information on it. When challenged by the provider for the SSN and date of birth, the man responded incorrectly.",
