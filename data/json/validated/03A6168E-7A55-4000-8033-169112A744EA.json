The hacker also warned of further attacks on the tightly governed island's technological infrastructure if demands for greater Internet freedom were not met. Singapore strictly regulates the traditional media. Its new Internet rules have sparked anger in the blogging and social media community, which says the rules are designed to muzzle free expression. Authorities insist the new licensing rules do not impinge on Internet freedom.",
