  "summary": "\"On August 23, 2025, Workday became aware of a security issue in Salesloft\u2019s Drift application, a third-party app that connects to Salesforce. Upon learning of the issue, we disconnected the app, invalidated Drift\u2019s tokens, and began removing any related integrations. We simultaneously began an investigation, with support from a forensic firm, and initiated an evaluation of Workday\u2019s vendors who use Drift.\n\nOn August 26, 2025, Salesloft provided additional information about the incident on their website, confirming that a threat actor had compromised its systems, obtained OAuth credentials, and had used those credentials to run searches in its customers\u2019 Salesforce environments. Our investigation identified that we had been impacted.\"",
