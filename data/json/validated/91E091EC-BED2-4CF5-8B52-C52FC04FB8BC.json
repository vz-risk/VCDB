  "summary": "The New Reporter contacted the Dorn VAMC to inform the Public Affairs Officer that Veteran #1 provided him with PHI, which was intended for four other Veterans.  The News Reporter provided the names of the four Veterans and informed the Public Affairs Officer that this incident will be a story featured on the news tonight. I contacted the Veteran by phone to inquire about the location of the mismailed documents. The Veteran was asked if she still possessed the four other Veterans PHI. She informed me that, yes she still has access to the documents, but she is not at home right now and will call me back. I expressed that whenever a Veterans PHI has been inappropriately disclosed, the VAMC must make every effort to retrieve the documents ASAP. I informed Veteran #1 that I will pick up the documents from her home. Once again she informed me that she will call me back.   Incident Update 05/23/13:\nDue to full SSN and medical information being exposed, Four Veterans will be sent letters offering credit protection services.",
