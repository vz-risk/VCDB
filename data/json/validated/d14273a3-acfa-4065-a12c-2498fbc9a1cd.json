  "summary": "A US education non-profit appears to have unwittingly leaked the personal information of thousands of students after leaving two online MongoDB databases exposed.  The privacy snafu was discovered by noted researcher Bob Diachenko and affected the Institute of International Education (IIE), an organization set up to promote educational and cultural exchanges with other countries.  \u201cAlthough the database itself did not contain documents, it did contain links with active access tokens to documents stored elsewhere,\u201d explained Security Discovery. \u201cLinks to passport scans, application forms, visas, emails, and other documents were discovered.\u201d  Also among the leaked data were medical forms, funding information, student dossiers, US arrival documents and tax forms.  As the links to the sensitive personal documents were contained in around three million log files, it\u2019s hard to estimate the total number of affected students, but Diachenko claimed they run into the thousands \u201cif not more.\u201d  Two identical MongoDB databases hosted at different IP addresses were left unsecured in the same manner, allowing anyone scanning for exposed systems to open them and take a look inside.  If either database was accessed it could provide a treasure trove of sensitive information for use in follow-on fraud, according to Security Discovery.  \u201cAn identity thief couldn\u2019t ask for a better payload. The alarming amount of personal and financial data would make it easy for a criminal to open up new accounts and lines of credit in victims\u2019 names, for example,\u201d it warned.  \u201cCollege-aged students are prime targets for identity theft because they often have clean credit reports and decent credit scores. We strongly urge impacted students to check their credit reports regularly in the upcoming months. Tax fraud is another threat, so impacted students should be on the lookout for tax scams during the upcoming tax season.\u201d  Although IIE secured the data on February 6, eight days after being alerted to the leak by Diachenko, it did not respond personally to any of his messages, or to provide any public comment to those affected.",
