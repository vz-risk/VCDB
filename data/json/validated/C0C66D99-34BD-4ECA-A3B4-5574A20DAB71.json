  "summary": "An Oshkosh psychotherapy office is advising about 500 patients of a potential breach of personal information.  ST Psychotherapy, LLC, says there was a burglary at the office at 627 Bay Shore Drive on Oct. 23.  Among the stolen items was a laptop computer with records of outpatient mental health clients seen from Nov. 7, 2012 through Aug. 19, 2014. It also contained psychological evaluations conducted between May 13, 2013 and Oct. 21, 2015 for the Wisconsin Disability Determination Bureau.  The office says the personal information includes names, addresses, dates of birth, social security numbers, medical histories, mental status interviews, results of psychological testing and statements of work capacity.  Dr. Scott Trippe says the burglary was reported to the Oshkosh Police Department, but the stolen laptop has not been recovered.  The doctor says steps are underway to further improve security operations \"and eliminate future risk.\" ",
