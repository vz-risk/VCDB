  "summary": "Panasonic UK has signed an Undertaking with the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) following the theft of an unencrypted laptop containing personal data relating to people who had attended a hospitality event run by a third party company on Panasonics behalf. The incident is a good reminder that your contracts with business associates or vendors need to include your stringent data security and data protection requirements.   The ICO learned on August 8, 2012 that a laptop computer containing the names, home addresses, contact details, dates of birth, nationality, passport details, dietary requirements and emergency contact details of 970 people who had attended hospitality events arranged by Panasonic UK had been stolen from an unlocked hotel room.  The laptop was password protected, but was not encrypted or physically secured in any way.",
