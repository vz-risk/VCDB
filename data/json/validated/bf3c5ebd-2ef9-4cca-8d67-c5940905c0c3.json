That email was sent to about 150 district employees, officials said.  Vendors were advised to place a fraud alert on their credit files as a precaution. Those vendors also were told by LCPS to check their credit reports and financial history for any signs of identity theft.  The district said the email was quickly discovered and steps were taken within hours to contain it.",
