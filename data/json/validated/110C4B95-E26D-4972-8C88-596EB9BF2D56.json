  "summary": "A group of hackers successfully compromised 220 million records containing personally identifiable information on 27 million people aged 15 to 65.  The breach came to light after 16 people were arrested following the theft of data from a number of online game and movie ticket sites.  The stolen records include real names, account names, passwords and resident registration numbers.  One of the 16 people detained, known simply as \"Kim\", is said by police to have obtained all 220 million records from a Chinese hacker he met through an online game in 2011.  Local authorities believe Kim then automatically logged in to the compromised online gaming accounts and stole game currency. He then allegedly exchanged that currency for real cash.",
