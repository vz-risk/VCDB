  "summary": "An electronic signature device which was improperly discarded caused a potential data breach for customers at ShopRite in the Town of Ulster.  The store \"inadvertently disposed of\" an electronic signature device used in the store's pharmacy in February 2016, resulting in the breach, according to a press release by ShopRite parent company Wakefern.   Customers who filled a prescription at the pharmacy between 2005 and 2015 were required to sign the device, and the device also stored data of customers who purchased over-the-counter medicine.",
