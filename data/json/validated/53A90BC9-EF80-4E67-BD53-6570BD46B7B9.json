  "summary": "Nonprofit biomedical research company Huntington Medical Research Institutes (HMRI) has announced two HIPAA breaches in the space of a month: One involving the improper disposal of records, the other an alleged theft of patient data by a former employee.  On August 6, 2015, HMRI discovered paper records and glass laboratory microscope slides had been disposed of in a way that did not comply with HIPAA regulations. The incident is believed to have occurred at some point in the two weeks prior to HMRI becoming aware of the HIPAA breach.  The incident resulted in sensitive material potentially being exposed including some diagnosis and treatment data, the source of the tissue being tested, specimen information, and details of the tests that had been ordered. The name of the referring physician, patient names, dates of birth, and potentially other demographic information was also contained in physical files. No Social Security numbers, credit card details or insurance information was exposed, although some patients' billing information was potentially also included in the files.  Patients are not believed to be at risk of harm or loss as a result of the breach.  ",
