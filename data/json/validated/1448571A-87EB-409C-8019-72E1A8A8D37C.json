      "notes": "running on an open source CMS script called \"Drupal\". Therefore, there could have been a vulnerability on the websites CMS, by Dell using an old version of the script or could have been due to admins using silly passwords.  Earlier, there had been an SQL injection exploit for the Drupal CMS version 7.32. The exploit had allowed hackers to inject into the websites database and get the hashed/encrypted password of admins which would then be cracked to gain access to the website admin control panel, allowing hackers to do anything with the website. This exploit could have been used on Dell websites which lead it to defacement. ",
