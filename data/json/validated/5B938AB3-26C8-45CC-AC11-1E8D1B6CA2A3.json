  "summary": "Ontario's Privacy Commissioner is investigating a privacy breach at Credit Valley Hospital after the personal health records of five patients were \"improperly accessed\" by an employee at a nearby medical building.  One of the complainants, who asked not to be identified, said the hospital sent her and her husband a letter after she came forward last month with allegations of their records being inappropriately accessed.  She said the hospital has \"audited\" the doctor's office in question, located at nearby 2300 Eglinton Avenue West, and has since denied access to the female employee involved.  Catherine Pringle, a spokesperson for Trillium Health Partners, a three-hospital group comprising Credit Valley, Mississauga Hospital and Queensway Health Centre, confirmed an individual working in a physician's office, who is not an employee of Credit Valley,  \"improperly accessed\" personal health information held in hospital records.",
