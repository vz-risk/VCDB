  "summary": "Computer equipment is issued to blind Veterans who are followed by the Visual Impairment Services Team (VIST). The Durham VA Medical Center requested a \nVACO Office of Blind Rehabilitation site visit in June 2012 to review concerns with management of the computer access training program. The VACO review \nidentified serious concerns with the actions of the vendor who provided computer access training and delivered and set up computers in patients homes. \nDuring a home visit with Patient A in June 2012, the Blind Rehabilitation Outpatient Specialist observed Patient Bs information on the computer issued to Patient \nA. In addition, a progress note on Patient Cs chart states that the computer issued to patient C was being re-issued to another patient because Patient C could \nnot participate in the program. Some patients who had received repeated training over a several year period received multiple computers and/or laptops, without \nclear documentation about why the equipment was being replaced. These findings raised concerns about whether the vendor was substituting used computers for \nbrand new computers ordered for individual patients. \nThe Office of the Inspector General (OIG) Criminal Investigation unit is further investigating the vendor for possible waste, fraud and abuse. He has requested that \nthe VAMC not communicate with the vendor or the VIST Coordinator who oversaw the program.\nPatient A has moved to Virginia. Her telephone number is blocked so that she doesnt receive incoming calls. The Information Security Officer (ISO) has sent her \na letter asking her to contact the ISO about the visit with the BROS Coordinator. \nThe core group of patients who received regular computer access training in 2011-2012 will be called to ask whether the computers they received were brand new or \nnot, and whether they ever found information belonging to another person on the equipment issued to them by VA. Results of this review will be used to determine \nwhether there is a need to swap all current equipment for up to 119 patients who received training between 2003 and 2012. \nDepending on the findings, credit monitoring would be offered for all patients trained in the last 2 years and their current Windows XP equipment will be swapped for \nWindows 7 devices. The Durham Office of Information and Technology would then pull the hard drives of all the returned equipment and sanitize them before \nsending them to Intelligent Decisions. Once the OIGs investigation is complete, the VIST Coordinator and contract vendor can be contacted to see if the \nequipment re-issue began before 2011",
