  "summary": "Ambulance bosses have been criticised after the unencrypted data of more than 45,000 patients was shared with NHS chiefs despite there being no justifiable legal reason to do so.  South Western Ambulance Service sent seven discs of descriptive patient data relating to 45,431 people by recorded delivery to a Clinical Commissioning Group in October 2013.  But while the discs were in possession of the CCG they were found to be unencrypted.",
