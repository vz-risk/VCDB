  "summary": "A VA medical assistant took two provider panel lists home in March, 2014 to work on them over a weekend. It is estimated that approximately 1500 Veterans are included on the list. The facility Privacy Officer is attempting to get an accurate list at this time. In August, 2014, the medical assistant's husband had found the list and told the nurse he is going to use it to have her fired. It was not in VA control at the time of the original incident report. The list contains the Veterans' names, Social Security numbers, VA provider names, and eligibility codes.",
