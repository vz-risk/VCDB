  "summary": "The website of the popular Indian English-language newspaper Hindustan Times has been hacked and defaced by a hacker calling himself Silent Hacker.  The Hackers Blog reports that the attacker has also leaked some data on Pastebin allegedly taken from the Hindustan Times databases.  The published information includes table structures, and login credentials used by administrators and moderators.  On the defaced page, the hacker said he had notified Hindustan Times of the vulnerability, but his reports were apparently ignored. Thats why he decided to make a demonstration regarding the threat posed by the security hole.  At the time of writing, the media organization seems to have removed the defacement page. Its uncertain if theyve also patched the security hole exploited by the hacker.",
