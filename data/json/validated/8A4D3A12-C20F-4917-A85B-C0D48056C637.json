  "summary": "A former senior vice president of PNC Bank's Palm Beach, Fla., office used her cellphone to snap pictures of her computer screen hours before she resigned to take a job with a competitor.  The bank's security software thwarted Daly's attempt to download customer data, the lawsuit states.  Not to be deterred, on Jan. 31, 2014, mere hours before her resignation from PNC, Daly was observed taking photographs of her computer screen with her mobile phone, the lawsuit claims. Ten boxes of customer files were missing after she left, the lawsuit says. ",
