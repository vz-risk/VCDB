  "summary": "A former Bethlehem nursing aide charged with stealing a dead resident's bank card was accepted Wednesday into a first-offender program that will allow her to avoid a criminal conviction.  Jennifer Roque, 29, of Bethlehem will see her record expunged provided she completes a year of probation and pays court costs and fines, under terms of Northampton County's Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition.  Roque, a certified nursing assistant at Kirkland Village senior-living community, was charged last year with access device fraud, receiving stolen property and theft.  On Sept. 27, Roque was working when she discovered resident Virginia Hohl on the floor near her bed. Hohl, 91, was pronounced dead at a hospital of natural causes, according to court records.  Police said Roque stole Hohl's bank card and $5 from her purse. She used the card to make various purchases at stores, and \"cited her need to feed her children\" to investigators as the motive for the thefts, police said.  Roque was caught after Hohl's daughter, Nancy Campbell, reported that the bank card had been used several times after her mother's death, police said.  Police said Roque made purchases at a gas station, a convenience store and a grocery store. Police also said Roque tried to use the bank card at a dollar store, a doughnut shop and an online shopping site.  Police were able to identify Roque from store surveillance photos, court records said.",
