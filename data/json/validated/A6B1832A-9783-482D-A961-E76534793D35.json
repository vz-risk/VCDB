  "summary": "A computer flash drive containing limited patient information on 586 children treated at Orlando Health's Arnold Palmer Medical Center has been misplaced and is being treated as a data security breach.  The information includes last names, assigned medical record numbers, dates of birth, gestational ages, birth weights, dates of hospitalizations, and in some cases, transfer dates of the children who were patients at either Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children or Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies between 2009 and 2013.  The flash drive  a small computer data memory device  does not include first names, Social Security numbers, parents' information or financial information, according to Orlando Health officials.  They suspect the device was lost, not stolen. But the hospital began contacting affected families Monday \"as a precautionary measure.\"  \"Arnold Palmer Medical Center takes this incident very seriously, and we are committed to protecting patients' health and personal information,\" said Steve Stallard, corporate director of compliance and information security at Orlando Health. \"We deeply regret any concern or inconvenience this may cause.''  Stallard says to date the hospital has no evidence that any of the information on the flash drive was accessed or used by any unauthorized individual  However, the hospital first learned the flash drive was missing on Feb. 12. An internal investigation and \"exhaustive\" search concluded it was actually lost on Jan. 28. Spokesman Geo Morales said the delay is \"just part of what we need to go through here internally to determine the proper course of action.\"  Patients' records are strictly guarded as confidential under the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) law. Orlando Health notified federal authorities.",
