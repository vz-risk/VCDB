  "summary": "Computer systems at some hospitals began failing over the weekend after Universal Health Systems, a major provider with over 400 locations primarily in the US, was hit by a cyberattack. With systems offline, some impacted hospitals resorted to filing patient information with pen and paper, reported NBC News.   Universal Health Systems issued a statement on Monday, confirming that its network was offline due to a security incident. While UHS has made no official statement regarding the attack, reports coming from employees show all the signs of a ransomware attack, starting with its launch during the night to avoid detection before encrypting as many systems as possible and the immediate shut down of all systems after it was discovered to prevent more devices getting locked.",
