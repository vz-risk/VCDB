  "summary": "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- A male suspect was arrested on May 1 for hacking into a popular local classic music website, the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) announced yesterday.  The police raided the apartment of the suspect, surnamed Shih (_), and seized his computer.  Investigators allege that the suspect used the computer in his hacking attempts.  During initial investigations, Shih confessed to the police that he hacked into the website's customer database and made unauthorized changes to customer data, the CIB said in a statement.  Shih also confessed that he has used a hacking technique called SQL injection to attack the website's database.  SQL injection is a code injection technique that exploits a security vulnerability in an application's software, the CIB said.  The investigation was launched by the bureau after it received a report from the website's operator who said its site was hacked in March.  The CIB urged local website operators to stay on alert regarding similar hacking attempts.",
