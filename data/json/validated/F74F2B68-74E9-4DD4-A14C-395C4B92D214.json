  "summary": "A Pharmacist self-reported accidently dispensing the wrong medication to Veteran A at the pick-up window. Veteran B who picked up the wrong medication was immediately notified per protocol, and asked to return it to pick-up the correct medications. Veteran B' name and medication information was compromised.  This is informational for Mis-Handling incidents and is the representative ticket. There were a total of 112 Mis-Handling incidents this reporting period. Because of repetition, the other 111 are not included in this report, but are included in the \"Mis-Handling Incidents\" count at the end of this report. In all incidents, Veterans will receive a notification letter and/or credit monitoring will be offered if appropriate.",
