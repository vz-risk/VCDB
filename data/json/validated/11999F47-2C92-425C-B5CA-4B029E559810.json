  "summary": "A defunct home health care management company that was based in San Antonio has been sued by the state over clients' personal information found in a recycling container at Stevenson Middle School.  Files belonging to Alliance Health Management & Consulting Inc. were recovered by Northside Independent School District police officers on July 14, 2014, and eventually were turned over to the Texas attorney general's office, according to a lawsuit filed against the company.  A spokeswoman for the attorney general's office, which filed the suit on Nov. 13 in Bexar County District Court, said it does not comment on ongoing litigation, so it couldn't be determined just how many of the company's one-time clients may have had their personal information left in the recycling container.",
