It claims to have more than 10,000 business clients and 1.8 million licensed users.  The website Bleeping Computer quoted the cyber security firm Cyble as saying a threat actor was selling the Nitro user and document databases, plus 1TB of documents, at a private auction, with the opening bid set at US$80,000 (A$112.237).  A Cyble spokesperson told iTWire in response to a query for comment: \"Considering the scale and extent of the breach, this is one of the worst breaches Cyble has seen in the last few years.",
