The company has found that two encrypted databases were accessed, but so far it has been unable to find any evidence that the data has been stolen. hacked-binary-290x230-iSTOCK.jpg  \u201cHowever, we have decided that it is safest to delete all the customer passwords used on our site and invite customers to reset their passwords next time they visit the Lakeland site,\u201d it told customers.  The company has also advised customers that if the password they used for Lakeland is used for other sites and services, they should update the password for those accounts too.",
