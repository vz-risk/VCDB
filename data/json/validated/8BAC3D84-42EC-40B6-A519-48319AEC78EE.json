  "summary": "On 03/29/10, Veteran A called the pharmacy to request that his prescription that was filled for him on 03/18/10 for window pick up, be mailed to him. Veteran As medication was sent down from the dispensing window to the vault to be packaged for mail on 03/29/10. Unfortunately, pharmacy personnel working at the vault was preparing Veteran B's prescription for mailing at the same time, and when the technician was interrupted with phone calls, inadvertently placed both medications into Veteran As sack. Veteran A brought back Veteran Bs prescription on 04/02/10. The medication was counted and found all #90 tablets accounted for. The vault technician was advised not to allow interruptions when preparing medications.",
