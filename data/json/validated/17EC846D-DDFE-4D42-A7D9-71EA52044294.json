  "summary": "Fitness website PayAsUGym has been breached in a hack that may have exposed up to 400K emails and passwords.  In a breach notice to users, the firm admitted one of its servers was hacked after \"underground researchers\" posted screenshots purporting to show PayAsUGym's hacked database via Twitter. The 1x0123 hacker crew later claimed that they planned to sell off the compromised database through underground markets.  PayAsUGym apparently used the obsolete MD5 hashing technology, making it straightforward to work out the corresponding passwords using a brute force attack and dictionary lookups.  Troy Hunt, the security researcher behind the haveibeenpwned breach notification website, warned over the weekend that \"PayAsUGym data appears to be circulating with \"more than 400k unique emails in there for UK customers\".  Hunt reposted a notice that admitted email addresses and passwords might have been breached. PayAsUGym, which says that it doesn't store credit card numbers, has reset user passwords.  Password reuse is always a bad idea. Those users who their PayAsUGym password at other sites are particularly exposed to so-called credential-stuffing attacks, where hackers try passwords exposed at one site at other sites.",
