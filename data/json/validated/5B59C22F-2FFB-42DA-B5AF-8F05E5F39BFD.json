  "summary": "A nurse at VA Puget Sound was concerned that former co-workers had accessed her record based on comments that some of them had made to her. She\nrequested a copy of her Sensitive Patient Access Report from the Privacy Officer (PO) and the Information Security Officer (ISO). After inspecting her copy of the\nreport, she stated that there were individuals listed on the report who should not have accessed her medical record as they were not part of her treatment or\nresponsible for payment related to her VA medical care. She has asked the Privacy Office and the Information Security Office to fully investigate.",
