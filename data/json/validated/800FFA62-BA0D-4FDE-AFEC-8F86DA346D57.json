  "summary": "A wellness nurse practitioner in Stone Mountain allegedly pocketed more than $1 million by charging insurance companies for services she never performed.    This week, a federal grand jury indicted her on charges of health care fraud and identity theft.  Between May 2013 and September 2014, prosecutors say Daphne Patterson billed five health insurance companies including United Healthcare and Aetna for more than $2.2 million. They say this was for services like allergy tests that she never performed on at least 20 people. Some of them she never met, but allegedly used their provider numbers to bill the insurance companies.     The indictment says Patterson first started filing false claims while working part-time at the Family Medical Center in Lawrenceville. She later started her own practice called Healthier U 4 Ever in Stone Mountain.  According to the indictment, she used the money to buy luxury watches and jewelry. If convicted, Patterson could face more than 20 years in prison, according to attorney Bob Brennan. ",
