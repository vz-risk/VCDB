  "summary": "Oregon Health Co-op of Portland warned its members on Tuesday that a company laptop with member and dependent information was stolen early this month.  Co-op officials said the laptop was taken April 3. The laptop was password-protected, but it contained sensitive information about members.  The information on the stolen laptop included current and former member and dependent names, addresses, health plan and identification numbers, dates of birth and Social Security numbers. No medical information was on the laptop.  There is no indication this personal information has been accessed or used.  To safeguard members from any potential misuse of the personal information, the Co-op is offering free identity theft protection services through ID Experts. The package includes 12 months of identity protection, a $20,000 insurance reimbursement policy in the event of identity theft, and access to fraud resolution representatives. ",
