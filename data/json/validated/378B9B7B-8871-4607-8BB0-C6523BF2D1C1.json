  "summary": "A resident from an affiliate hospital had a logbook stolen out of his vehicle at the affiliate hospital. This logbook contained information on all patients he has seen in the Omaha VAMC Operating Room (OR) for the past 20 months, so he could track his procedures and types of anesthetics he used. The resident stated that he would either just write in the patient's age, case, procedure type, and anesthetic used (with no identifiers) or in some instances he took a patient's label with their full name, SSN, and DOB and stuck it in the log. He does not know what patients were in his log.",
