  "summary": "Veteran A owes a debt to the VA and the debt was listed under Physician A. The bill of collection was issued for Beneficiary Travel Fraud; these types of bills are handled by Fiscal service. Physician B claims that he called PAS several times, however because beneficiary travel bills are handled by Fiscal, PAS would have no knowledge of the debt or be able to access the debt in the VISTA system. Physician B is concerned that his identity might be stolen.",
