  "summary": "A group of Iranian hackers going with the handle of Islamic Cyber Resistance (ICRG), who call themselves Anonymous as well have claimed to breach an Israeli job (http://www.zerem.co.il/) website and leak personal details of 70,000 registered users. The breach was conducted under the banner of #OpSaveGaza.  In an exclusive email conversation, hackers from Islamic Cyber Resistance explained that the job site was hacked in support of Palestine and against the Israeli attacks on Gaza.  We have leaked all 1500 Image Files for now to show our support for Palestinian People and in order to warn all Jewish people that are working With The Zionist Regime, according to Iranian hackers. After analyzing the data we have found names, surnames, phone numbers, emails and pictures. The data seems to be legit and couldnt be found online before today.  The leaked data is available for download on below given links.  https://www.quickleak.org/DJNIdlXc https://www.quickleak.org/BY6NLaNH https://www.quickleak.org/sWgwlXEb Images are available in below given link. The password of image folder is ICRG.  https://anonfiles.com/file/62d620fdceaca7c92e2285925fed06a1 As the conflict between Palestine and Israel is growing, there has been an increase in cyber attacks against Israel. Israeli watchdog has already confirmed that these cyber attacks are impossible to stop and harming the cyber infrastructure in the country.  Read all the hacks and breachers conducted by hacktivists under the banner of #OpSaveGaza here.  Note: As mentioned above the leaked data seems legit but does it really belongs to Israeli users is something we cant confirm.",
