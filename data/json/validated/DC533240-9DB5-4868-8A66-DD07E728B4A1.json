  "summary": "An Orillia hospital has caught four clerical employees peering into patient files.  Some 52 patients of Soldiers' Memorial Hospital had their personal health information breached over the last five years, hospital spokesperson Terry Dyni confirmed Monday.  In the worst case, a clerk looked at 43 patient records.  \"Curiosity was the reason. Through our investigation into this matter, (the hospital) is confident that the access information was not shared,\" Dyni said.  All four privacy breaches were identified through routine hospital audits.",
