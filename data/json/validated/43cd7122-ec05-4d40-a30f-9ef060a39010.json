  "summary": "The Virginia State Police were able to recover just over half of the $600,000 that was stolen from Spotsylvania County in a business email compromise scheme.  The state police, working with other in and out-of-state law enforcement agencies were able to track down deposits made in multiple banks, Fredricsburgh.com reported. The $347,000 recovered will be returned to the district this week and the investigation is continuing. No arrests have been made.  The incident took place two weeks ago when a fake invoice was sent to the school district requesting payment for a new turf field installed at Courtland High School. District officials were fooled and sent a partial payment for the $1.2 million job, but it did not go to the company that performed the work Fredricksburgh.com reported.",
