  "summary": "The Oregon Department of Veterans' Affairs says the personal information of hundreds of veterans may have been compromised.  ODVA Director Cameron Smith said discharge and release papers may have been in the possession of an unauthorized person, but so far there's no evidence of misuse. \"A full investigation is pending _ but it appears that 967 veterans' personal information was shared outside of our control with an individual outside of our agency,\" said Smith.  He said the information was in paper form, not digital. The ODVA is letting veterans know about the problem and offering free credit services because the forms contained social security numbers, dates of birth, addresses and full names.",
