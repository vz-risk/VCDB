The attacker was able to copy files from the account and device on November 20, 2024.  The files were reviewed to determine the data obtained in the attack, and notification letters were mailed to the affected individuals on February 28, 2025. The stolen data included names and Social Security numbers. The affected individuals have been offered complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for 24 months and Lockton has implemented additional safeguards to prevent similar incidents in the future.\"",
