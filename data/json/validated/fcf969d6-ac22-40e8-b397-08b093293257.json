  "summary": "Saskatoon city manager Jeff Jorgensen has admitted that the city has lost $1.04 million to a fraudster posing as a construction company\u2019s chief financial officer for weeks. An expert now believes that the money may have been sent overseas and it is possible the city will never see the over $1 million in taxpayer money again.  The City of Saskatoon has been affected by a fraud scheme, where a fraudster electronically impersonated the CFO of a construction company and asked for a change of banking information.  The City complied, and as a result, the next contract payment intended to go to that company, $1.04 million, was directed to the fraudster\u2019s bank account.  The fraud was identified on August 12, 2019.",
