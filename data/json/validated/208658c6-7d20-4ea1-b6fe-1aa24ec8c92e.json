  "summary": "Hundreds of sensitive council documents found in London estate.  Child protection and rent arrears documents - showing names, addresses, and confidential information - were found on the Gauden Estate, Clapham. Campaigners say the find could include files missing from a historical sexual abuse investigation, which they believe was \"covered up\". Lambeth Council has moved the files to a \"secure location\" for review. The Shirley Oaks Survivors Association say the discovery could include 140 boxes of council documents that have gone missing, related to abuse suffered at the Shirley Oaks Childrens' Home.",
