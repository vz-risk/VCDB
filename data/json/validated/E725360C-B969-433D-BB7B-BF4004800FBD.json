  "summary": "The first data breach occurred in July when it was discovered that approximately 1,700 index cards with names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, addresses and medical coding were missing after the department moved to its new building. The information affected patients in the Children Special Services (CSS) program dating back to 2003.  We are letting them know we started an investigation immediately and we do not believe, according to our investigation, that any of their information was accessed, health department spokesman Brian Todd told an ABC affiliate at the time. We believe those index cards probably ended up in a landfill.  Todd added that when the department realized those files were missing, it did a thorough review of all files that were moved from the old building to the new building. No other files were found to be missing, so if an individual came for any other service, were not impacted, Todd said.  According to the news source, the health department had the index cards to comply with regulations that require it keeps records on CSS participants for 20 years. As a precaution, the department announced it was offering all the impacted people one year of free identity protection through AllClear ID. Should an issue of identity theft occur, patients simply need to contact AllClear ID  they do not need to enroll in the program.",
