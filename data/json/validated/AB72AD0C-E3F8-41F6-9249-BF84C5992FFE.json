  "summary": "The Signal Mountain Police Department has revealed new details in the case of a nurse's assistant charged with identity theft.  A post on the department's Facebook page says 20-year-old Marcus Nix is accused of stealing information for several elderly victims at the Alexian Village of Tennessee Retirement Community.  The Hamilton County Grand Jury handed down several new indictments for Nix on charges that include Identity Theft Trafficking. He now faces a total of 16 felony charges.  Nix was taken into custody at the Signal Mountain Police Department on Saturday.  He is now in the Hamilton County Jail under a $35,000 bond.  The Signal Mountain Police Department says Alexian Brothers notified the department immediately of the theft, which they say prevented Nix from acting on his ill-gotten gains. The department said he tried to get loans or credit cards from several banks, credit card companies and other loan companies, but wasn't able to do so, because his applications were flagged when the investigation began.  The department says other charges are pending in Blount County, Tennessee and in Florida.",
