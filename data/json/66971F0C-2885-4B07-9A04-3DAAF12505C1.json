  "summary": "A grand jury has indicted the owner of a Durham-based health care company on 15 criminal charges, including health care fraud and identity theft. A warrant has been issued for her arrest.  Investigators say Tracie Yvette Clay, chief executive of N.C. Behavioral Health and Counseling Services, submitted claims for services for at least 56 clients  none of whom received the services. She received approximately $1 million from Medicaid, which she used to buy a Cadillac Escalade, a Mercedes and a pool, according to court records.  Clay was the subject of a WRAL investigation in July 2012 after records showed that N.C. Behavioral Health billed Medicaid for more than $712,000 in counseling services in 2011, including 3,237 therapy sessions for a total of 7,920 hours. Thats nearly 22 hours a day, every day of the year, all billed in the name of one psychologist, Eunice Ngumba-Gatabaki.  Gatabaki told WRAL News that she had never heard of the agency and was angry and concerned that the business used her provider number for all of its Medicaid billing. She offered to cooperate fully with any investigation. Clay declined to comment at the time. ",
