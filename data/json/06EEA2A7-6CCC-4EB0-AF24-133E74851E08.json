  "summary": "A clerk faxed a report to a physicians office on 03/13/13. Today, a call was received from an insurance agency, stating that they had received records from this \nfacility and did not know what claim they were for. It was confirmed that they received the 03/13/13 fax intended for the physicians office. \nThe odd thing about this is, both the physicians office and the insurance company claim that the fax number these records were sent to belongs to them. The \nfacility received the request from the physicians office from this fax. The facility is following up to try to discover how this happened but, at this point, it does not \nappear to be the facilitys error.",
