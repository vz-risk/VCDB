  "summary": "\"Agility PR confirmed it was impacted by the Salesloft Drift OAuth compromise that targeted Salesforce customers. An unauthorized party accessed Agility\u2019s Salesforce instance via a third-party integration, leading to the limited exposure of organizational data. The investigation found that the majority of accessed data was non-client identifiable, though a subset of business contact information and support ticket metadata for a small number of clients was involved. No usernames, passwords, proprietary data, or financial information were compromised. Agility PR promptly revoked Drift access, conducted an internal assessment, and continues to monitor for potential misuse. Customers are advised to remain cautious of social engineering attempts.\"",
