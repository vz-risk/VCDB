  "summary": "\"Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts (BCBSM) members are being notified about a security breach at one of its vendors, Cierant Corporation, a printing and mailing vendor. On December 10, 2024, a hacker exploited a vulnerability in the Cleo VL Trader tool, which is used by Cierant for secure file transfers. The hacker obtained files that contained names, addresses, and limited protected health information of 4,855 BCBSM members. When the hacking incident was detected, Cierant ceased use of Cleo VLTrader, rotated passwords, and took several other steps to enhance network security. Cierant is issuing notification letters to the affected individuals and has offered complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.  In the case of Cierant, the HHS data breach tracker shows that more than 232,000 people are impacted.\n\nIn a data incident notice, the company revealed that it was targeted in late 2024 in the attacks in which the notorious Cl0p ransomware group exploited vulnerabilities in Cleo file transfer products to gain access to the files of organizations that had been using the impacted applications.\n\nCl0p targeted dozens of organizations through these vulnerabilities, and in some cases the victims were companies providing services to healthcare organizations. Some incidents have impacted a significant number of people.\n\nCierant was listed on Cl0p\u2019s leak website as a victim of the Cleo attack in early February. The cybercriminals at some point claimed that the stolen files had been made public, but SecurityWeek was unable to verify those claims.\n\nCierant, which had used Cleo\u2019s VLTrader tool, said the compromised files stored personal and health data processed on behalf of third-party health plans.\n\n\u201cThe types of personal information that may have been involved vary by person and can include the following: name, address, date of birth, treatment-related dates, a generic description of services received, provider name, medical record number, health plan beneficiary number, claims number, and/or plan member account number, premium information,\u201d Cierant said.\"",
