  "summary": "\"When news broke that Toppan Next Tech \u2014 a key print vendor for the Singapore Police Force, DBS Bank, Bank of China, and the Elections Department \u2014 had suffered a ransomware attack, it sent ripples through Singapore\u2019s public and private sectors.\n\nAlthough the breach did not affect general election operations, the personal data of citizens, including names and addresses, was believed to have been compromised in April. These leaked details are a gold mine for scammers seeking to craft highly believable social engineering attacks. In 2024, scam victims in Singapore reportedly lost a record US$1.1 billion, and more than three in four of them voluntarily transferred the money themselves. These scams are so psychologically effective that lawmakers have even empowered police to restrict banking access for victims who cannot believe they are being manipulated.\n\nThe harsh reality of this breach is that no organisation is immune to supply chain threats, especially when trust is outsourced. And when partners slip up, the everyday person pays the price. Regardless of an organisation\u2019s size or sector, cybersecurity can no longer stop at the network\u2019s edge.\"",
