    "summary": "\"Dialysis company DaVita says more than 900,000 people affected by April ransomware attack  Almost a million people had sensitive healthcare information stolen during a ransomware attack on dialysis company DaVita in April.  The company began filing breach notification letters in several states this week, informing regulators in Oregon, Texas, South Carolina, Washington and Massachusetts that a total of 915,952 U.S. residents were affected by the incident.  DaVita said it discovered the cyberattack on April 12, when network servers at its laboratories were breached.  The company said it was able to remove the cybercriminals from its systems on the same day, but an investigation revealed that they were able to access DaVita’s dialysis labs database.  The information stolen includes demographic data, names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, health insurance information and other clinical information like health conditions, dialysis lab test results and treatment information.  “For some individuals, the information included tax identification numbers, and in limited cases images of checks written to DaVita,” the letters add.\"",
