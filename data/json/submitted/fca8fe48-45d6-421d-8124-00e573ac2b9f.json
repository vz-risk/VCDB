  "summary": "Personal data of individuals who applied to Ohio\u2019s Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program was exposed in a data breach on May 15, causing information of at least two dozen applicants to be seen by other claimants in the program, according to a letter shared by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.  Deloitte Consulting, the company contracted with ODJFS to assist the state in administering the program, told applicants in a letter that personal information such as their names, Social Security numbers, street addresses and receipt of unemployment compensation benefits were inadvertently available for others to view.",
