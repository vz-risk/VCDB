  "summary": "\"Digital engineering outfit GlobalLogic says personal data from more than 10,000 current and former employees was exposed in the wave of Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) attacks attributed to the Clop ransomware gang. The Hitachi-owned biz joins a growing roster of high-profile victims that also now includes The Washington Post and Allianz UK.\n\nIn a filing with Maine's attorney general, the US-based GlobalLogic said that 10,471 individuals were affected after criminals gained unauthorized access to its systems.\n\nIn notification letters sent to those impacted, seen by The Register, GlobalLogic admitted the stolen data included names, addresses, Social Security numbers, passport information, and bank account details.\n\nGlobalLogic said its investigation identified the earliest date of criminal activity as July 10, 2025, with the most recent occurring on August 20, 2025. This aligns with findings from Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) and Mandiant, which said that suspicious HTTP traffic targeting Oracle EBS servers began in early July.\n\nThe disclosure makes GlobalLogic one of the latest victims of the widespread exploitation of Oracle EBS vulnerabilities disclosed earlier this year, which have since been linked to the Clop cybercrime group. The attackers are believed to have exploited flaws tracked as CVE-2025-61882 and CVE-2025-61884 in Oracle's enterprise resource planning software, targeting organizations that left their systems exposed to the internet.\"",
