We disconnected the application and began an investigation, engaging with both Salesloft and Salesforce.\n\nSalesloft confirmed that a threat actor had compromised its systems, stole credentials, and used those credentials to run searches in customers\u2019 Salesforce environments.\n\nOur investigation confirmed that we had been impacted. At this time, there is no evidence that Salesloft\u2019s security incident affected Avalara\u2019s software or services, or customer data contained within them.\"",
