    "summary": "iSpace, Inc., a provider of insurance eligibility services, has recently started notifying 24,382 individuals about a cyberattack that was discovered on February 5, 2023. In a May 31, 2023, notification to the California Attorney General, iSpace explained that the forensic investigation confirmed a system compromise had occurred and that there was file exfiltration between January 30 and February 5, 2023.  The analysis of the impacted files confirmed that they contained names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, diagnosis information, health insurance group/policy numbers, health insurance information, subscriber numbers, and prescription information. At the time of issuing notifications, no actual or attempted misuse of the affected individuals’ information had been detected. iSpace said it engaged the services of security specialists to assist in examining its privacy and security policies and practices and will update them accordingly. The delay in issuing notifications was due to the lengthy investigation and data review process, which was completed on March 3, 2023, and the subsequent verification of contact information.",
