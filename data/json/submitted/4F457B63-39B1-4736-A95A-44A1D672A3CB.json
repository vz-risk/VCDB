The stolen data includes customer names, email addresses, job titles, phone numbers, and location data. In addition, product licenses, commercial information, and the content of certain support cases have also been compromised. The company emphasizes that only the Salesforce environment has been affected, not the Zscaler products themselves or internal infrastructure.\"",
