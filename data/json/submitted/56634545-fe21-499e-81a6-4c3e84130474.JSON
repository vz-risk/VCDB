    "summary": "\"The personal data of hundreds of thousands of legal aid applicants in England and Wales dating back to 2010, including criminal records and financial details, has been accessed and downloaded in a “significant” cyber-attack.  Officials admit that the data may have included contact details and addresses of applicants, their dates of birth, national ID numbers, criminal history, employment status and financial data such as contribution amounts, debts and payments.  Hackers have claimed that they accessed 2.1m pieces of data, a figure that has so far been unverified.  It is understood that authorities do not believe that the hack is the work of a state actor, and that it appears to be the work of a criminal gang.\" \"On Wednesday 23 April, we became aware of a cyber-attack on the Legal Aid Agency’s online digital services.  These are the services through which legal aid providers log their work and receive payment from the Government.  In the days following the discovery, we took immediate action to bolster the security of the system, and informed all legal aid providers that some of their details, including financial information, may have been compromised.  Since then, we have worked closely with the National Crime Agency and National Cyber Security Centre as well as informing the Information Commissioner.  On Friday 16 May we discovered the attack was more extensive than originally understood and that the group behind it had accessed a large amount of information relating to legal aid applicants.  We believe the group has accessed and downloaded a significant amount of personal data from those who applied for legal aid through our digital service since 2010. \"",
