  "summary": "\"PowerSchool has now confirmed that they have paid a ransom in an attempt to secure deletion of the impacted data. As with any such incident, there was a risk that the threat actors would not honour their commitment to delete the stolen data, despite assurances provided to PowerSchool,\u201d the TDSB letter read.\n\nThe sensitive information was not indeed erased, as it was used this week to extort schools, including the TDSB.\n\n\u201cEarlier this week, TDSB was made aware that the data was not destroyed. TDSB, along with other North American school boards, received a communication from a threat actor demanding a ransom using data from the previously reported December 2024 incident,\u201d the letter read.\n\nPowerSchool, in a separate statement on Wednesday, said it was aware of the new ransom demands and has reported the matter to Canadian and American authorities.  Computer hacker and former college student Matthew Lane \u2014 who was a teenager when he carried out a massive cyberattack on education technology company PowerSchool \u2014 was sentenced in federal court on Tuesday to four years in prison and ordered to pay more than $14 million in restitution.  Lane\u2019s sentencing concludes a yearlong cybercrime saga, which began in September 2024 when prosecutors say he hacked into PowerSchool\u2019s computer network and transferred stolen records to a leased server in Ukraine. About three months later, PowerSchool officials received the extortion demand to prevent sensitive student and teacher data \u2014 including the Social Security numbers of children as young as 5 \u2014 from being leaked \u201cworldwide.\u201d \"",
