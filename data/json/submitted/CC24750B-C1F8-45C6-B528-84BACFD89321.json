  "summary": "\"A breach at Oracle Health impacts multiple US healthcare organizations and hospitals after a threat actor stole patient data from legacy servers.\n\nOracle Health has not yet publicly disclosed the incident, but in private communications sent to impacted customers and from conversations with those involved, BleepingComputer confirmed that patient data was stolen in the attack.\n\nOracle Health, formerly known as Cerner, is a healthcare software-as-a-service (SaaS) company offering Electronic Health Records (EHR) and business operations systems to hospitals and healthcare organizations. After being acquired by Oracle in 2022, Cerner was merged into Oracle Health, with its systems migrated to Oracle Cloud.  In a notice sent to impacted customers and seen by BleepingComputer, Oracle Health said it became aware of a breach of legacy Cerner data migration servers on February 20, 2025.\n\n\"We are writing to inform you that, on or around February 20, 2025, we became aware of a cybersecurity event involving unauthorized access to some amount of your Cerner data that was on an old legacy server not yet migrated to the Oracle Cloud,\" reads a notification sent to impacted Oracle Health customers. Oracle says that the threat actor used compromised customer credentials to breach the servers sometime after January 22, 2025, and copied data to a remote server. This stolen data \"may\" have included patient information from electronic health records.\n\nHowever, multiple sources told BleepingComputer that it was confirmed that patient data was stolen during the attack.\"",
