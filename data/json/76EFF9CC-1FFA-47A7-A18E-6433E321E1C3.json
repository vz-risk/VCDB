  "summary": "A Headland police officer, Jason Carey Hughes, pleaded guilty in 2009 to using the Law Enforcement Tactical System database to look up the criminal background of a minor. Court records indicate Hughes believed the minor raped one of his relatives. If the minor was ever tried or convicted of rape, there's no publicly available court record of it. After Hughes was kicked off the police force, the former officer was also convicted of drug distribution.",
