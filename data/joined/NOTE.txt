NOTE:
The joined json file includes about 5,000 repetitive web skimmer breaches under their own directory.  While they are legitimate breaches, they were discovered by script all at once and will therefore bias the dataset.  I recommend either normalizing that portion of the data or recreating the file with the vcdb_to_joined.py script without the '-r' (recursive) flag.
A normalised joined vcdb filed is available with the name vcdb-joined.json
